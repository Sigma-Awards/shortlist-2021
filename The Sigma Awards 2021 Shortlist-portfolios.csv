Nigeria,"The Nation Newspaper, Nigeria",Big,Justina Asishana," I am Justina Asishana, I have been working as a Journalist for the past seven years. I am a graduate of the National Open University of Nigeria and began my Journalism career as a Staff with New Nigerian Newspaper before moving down to Daily Newswatch newspaper and after it went down, I began writing for The Nation Newspaper where I am currently employed.        In 2019, I recieved a training on Data and Investigative Journalism by the Premium Times Center for Investigative Journalism in Nigeria and in 2020, I recieved another training on Data and Solutions Journalism by the Pan Atlantic University in Nigeria. After these trainings, I have tried my best in infusing data and infographics into my reporting.        I  am inspired in infusing data and infographics into my reportage because it makes it easier for the people to understand and due to the limited reading span of an individual, I realize that they relate and understand the infographics more than straight reporting.        During this period, I was contacted by the African Women Journalism Project (AWJP) to write reports regarding COVID-19 and they encouraged the use of data and infographics, this made me embrace the fellowship and used a lot of infographics in my stories with the help of those in the project.        I have realized that although there is limited data in Nigeria but Journalists can either generate data on their own or use the available data and infuse it into their reportage, this, I think would make journalists embrace data journalism and not see it as too cumbersome. I am inspired to using and infusing data into my reportage because it is interesting and fun of making something complex into a simple process where the people in can understand.        I should be considered for this award because it would give me an opportunity to expand my network in data journalism and connect me with other experts who will take me through the new aspects of days journalism. It would also boost my zeal in writing more data oriented stories.        Lastly, it has been on my mind to improve the capacity of journalists who are my colleagues on Data journalism and how they can infuse data into their reportage.  "," In my portfolio, I have various data stories relating to health, finance and women issues; majority of the project was done with a focus on the impact of COVID-19.    In the virus pandemic story, it was difficult in getting data of women affected financially by COVID-19, while a lot of people were confessing to have lost their jobs, the only available data in Nigeria was by the National Bureau of Statistics and the data did not really focus on women. A data analyst in the Africa Women Journalism Project helped in drawing the visualization.    In the family planning story, ""baby boom looms in Niger"", I used data gotten from health centers I visited. I drew up the visualization myself, so also is the deforestation story.    The other story was done in collaboration with a data analyst who designed the visualization with the data I presented.  ",https://thenationonlineng.net/virus-pandemic-as-financial-tsunami-for-women/,https://thenationonlineng.net/covid-19-how-niger-govt-bridged-learning-gap/amp/,https://thenationonlineng.net/agricultural-processors-bemoan-covid-19-losses/,https://thenationonlineng.net/malnutrition-a-silent-pandemic-ravaging-children/,https://thenationonlineng.net/deforestation-worsens-climate-change-ii/,https://thenationonlineng.net/covid-19-baby-boom-looms-in-niger-state/,,,,,,,,
Spain,Mundo Deportivo,Small,"Ferran Morales, Mundo Deportivo","  I am Ferran Morales, I have been working at Mundo Deportivo for 21 years, currently we mainly do work for the web but we still maintain the commitment to make double pages of paper we continue to maintain, in this complicated 2020 where many competitions were not disputed it was very complicated, but thanks to the bet of the medium we were able to maintain and even exceed the quality of previous years. I am a very restless person and I always try to evolve year after year, I believe that the adaptation of new methodologies to carry out some online jobs (scrolltelling) will help us to do better jobs in the coming years.","The work presented are both digital and printed pieces of work published at El Mundo Deportivo.


Last year I built together with Angel Rigueira (the Tennis Editor at El Mundo Deportivo) a graphic about Rafa Nadal that got a finalist at the Sigma Awards. This year, our goal was to compare the Big Three (Rafa, Federer and Djokovic). 


We first built a printed version, double page (Big Three PDF), visualizing data from each tournament by player, with a closer deep dive on the number of points, Grand Slams, court surface and the classification from the ATP ranking. 


When doing the digital piece, we completely changed the point of view, including a scroll to highlight specific information. 


Leo Messi beat Pele's record as the player with the highest amount of goals scored with the same team. Together with Gabriel Sans (football editor), we gathered data from each goal: from where was this scored, its trajectory, season, journey, amongst other data. 


In order to adapt this to the online version, as we wanted to keep all the data, we had to gather these in a different manner, using the scroll again, so that we could highlight the most important facts or data. 



Lastly, I present the visualization done to celebrate the 700 goals scored by Leo Messi with th FC Barcelona and the Argentina selection. For this one, we filtered by competition and team that received the goal, amongst other data. The main image for this piece was the one about Messi with his thumbs pointing to the sky.

 

Tools used were Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Ai2Html, Java Script, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery and Google Spreadsheet. All data was gathered and saved in a Google spreadsheet.

India,"Mint, IndiaSpend, Medium, Soundcloud and Podcast websites for Podcast",Small,Rukmini S," I am an independent data journalist based in Chennai, India.   I have been a journalist since 2004, and for my first four years, I was a beat reporter with The Times of India, the world's most widely circulated newspaper, in Mumbai. I covered schools and colleges, courts and police stations, slums and high-rises, human rights abuses and resistances, and the government. As a rookie reporter, I was dispatched across the length and breadth of the city and its surroundings, and the experience was invaluable. What it did was to show mw how the levers of democracy actually work.   After taking up the Felix Scholarship to do an MSc in Development Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, I returned to India in 2009 and joined the Times Insight Group, a small team of data journalists, at The Times of India in Delhi. My work focused on politics, gender, inequality and crime. I travelled the length and breadth of the country in addition to my data work - on the trail of the first female candidates for electoral office in India's easternmost state, on the frontlines of village elections in India's westernmost state, in small local courtrooms, in farms and factories.   In 2013, I joined The Hindu, India's third largest English newspaper, as National Data Editor, the first Data Editor in an Indian newsroom. From 2013 to 2016, I led the organisation's data reporting through one keenly contested national election and several state elections, multiple budgets, Censuses, and other key moments. I carved a niche for myself as a journalist with the ground reporting abilities to procure exclusive data, and put it in proper context, as well as the data analytic abilities to draw new insights from the data, and the storytelling abilities to open new windows in the minds of readers. For a readership that was seeking to cut through rhetoric and partisan news reporting, this fresh data-driven approach was welcome, as our numbers began to show.   Two projects I did at The Hindu stood out. One, put data from India's religious Census in context, upturning the prevailing false narrative that fed Islamophbia. The other analysed cases of sexual assault to uncover the range of nuance that police statistics hid.   I left The Hindu after having my first baby in 2016 and later joined HuffPost India as Editor, Data & Innovation. After my second baby was born in 2017, I moved to working independently. I am now a columnist for Mint and IndiaSpend, and an occasional writer for a host of Indian and foreign publications, as well as the host of my own podcast. I believe I have established myself as one of India's foremost data journalists, and a compelling storyteller.   I won the Likho Awards for Excellence in Media in 2019 for data-driven reporting on changing attitudes to homosexuality. In 2020, I received an Honourable Mention for the Chameli Devi Jain Awards for an Outstanding Woman Journalist.   I believe that my body of work in 2020, a particularly challenging year for most and for me certainly, is something to be proud of. I was able to communicate both fact and uncertainty with a country full of questions, and tackle not just questions around health and reporting, but also the ripple effects on society and the economy. I would be honoured to be considered for the Sigma Awards 2021. ","I am an independent data journalist based in Chennai, India. I was the first Data Editor in an Indian newsroom when I was National Data Editor of The Hindu newspaper from 2013-2016, and my first ten years of journalism was exclusively for print (and allied digital) organisations. From 2016 to 2018, I was Editor (Data & Innovations) at HuffPost India, my first digital-only job. I have been an independent journalist since August 2018, and for me, 2020 was the year of exploring data journalism across media and formats. For the Indian media organisation India Today, I tracked covid numbers nearly daily to pick up trends in surges and declines early. I created original datasets using both publicly available data from Indian states and countries across the world, as well as data obtained through my reporting. My reporting identified early insights including on the possible impact on numbers of antigen testing in India, the emergence of high mortality hotspots in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Punjab that warranted closer monitoring, and states where numbers were unusually steady and lacked variation, meriting some scepticism. The articles were frequently the most widely read on India Today's website in , got the attention of the government, and were widely shared on social media. Officials charged with the pandemic response in Indian states contacted me for further insight from what I was seeing in the numbers to help tackle their outbreaks. For the Indian data journalism IndiaSpend, I wrote deeply researched and reported analytical pieces, often using data never accessed before, on the broader stories of the pandemic - addressing whether India was under-counting covid deaths and how it could fill in the blanks, trying to answer what could explain some of the mysteries of India's numbers, and interviewing experts and doctors from across the country. The articles were well received by the health and policy communities as well as from readers who were seeking proper context over enduring questions over Indian numbers. One reported story that showed how the pandemic had brought routine health services to a crash was brought up by MPs with the Indian government in Parliament. For the Indian newspaper Mint, I wrote data-driven pieces on the socio-economic impact and context of covid - what it meant for women in India's workforce, how India was in danger of missing disease and death among its most marginalised, how healthcare costs and the mode of accessing healthcare was important to understand covid. For international publications including The Guardian and South China Morning Post, I wrote analytical pieces using my insights from the data to explain the situation in the country and assess policy responses. The pieces helped ignite a conversation about whether the ""new normal"" was going to be more or less equal, and what India's existing struggles with state capacity and healthcare delivery meant for our covid response. Since March 2020, I also began a pandemic podcast, The Moving Curve, researched and recorded myself at home. I draw upon my data work and interviews with experts and those on the ground to break down news and insights from the pandemic for listeners who are looking for distillation and synthesis. I was floored by the reception to the podcast, and each new episode is met with praise for people looking for calm and unbiased data analysis and commentary. I am now over 108 episodes in, have built a loyal following, and won an Emergent Ventures Covid-19 India Prize for the podcast. Between them, these projects constitute my portfolio for 2020, and I am proud of my body of work in a challenging",medium.com/@rukminiwrites,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19-indian-exceptionalism-may-not-explain-low-mortality/,https://www.indiaspend.com/health/india-may-be-reversing-decades-of-progress-on-child-nutrition-new-govt-data-show-701363,https://www.indiaspend.com/why-audits-reconciled-death-data-are-still-missing-covid-deaths/,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19-disrupted-indias-routine-health-services/,https://www.indiaspend.com/do-we-really-know-why-covid-19-spikes-in-some-places/,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-poor-suffer-cough-and-cold-routinely-making-coronavirus-detection-difficult-11585544409496.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-india-migrants-walked-back-home-11590564390171.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-post-covid-recovery-in-employment-has-not-been-equal-for-men-and-women-11605509801472.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/your-caste-and-class-determines-how-you-spend-time-11602657834829.html,,,,
United Kingdom,"BBC, Local News Partnerships",Big,BBC Shared Data Unit," Dear judges,   I'd like to put forward for consideration the work of the BBC's Shared Data Unit (SDU) during 2020, a unique exercise in collaborative journalism.   During the pandemic, the team has explored and explained the implications of the pandemic to UK audiences through data.  We have brought dozens of datasets into the public domain through our open Github repository, along with accompanying methodology and code.   https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/shared-data-unit     Background    The SDU was set up to support the development of data journalism skills across the local news industry. This was in recognition of the growing importance of these skills in the face of more data being created and made available than ever before in all areas of public life, including local government.  It is a key initiative within the BBC and industry Local News Partnerships (LNP)     The unit delivers: a) The creation of large-scale data investigations in the form of data packs that LNP Partners can access and use to create stories of local interest and relevance b) Training courses for journalists that provide them with the necessary skills and experience to bring back to their home newsrooms.   The SDU aims to bring high quality investigative journalism to its local partner network and the BBC.  Its reporters take the time and space to work on exclusive investigative journalism, using cutting edge digital techniques to tell stories that would otherwise go untold.   One of the unique successes of the SDU has been to bring together journalists from media organisations to work on stories in collaboration.  Secondees bring fresh ideas to the SDU core team, who help work on those ideas and bring them to publication across our public network.     The stories have generated hundreds of local stories for more than 400 partner outlets.   The unit's output also generated content for network BBC programmes including the News Channel, Radio 2, BBC Radio 4 Today, Five Live, and the One, Six and Ten O'Clock news.  It has generated hundreds of news bulletins or leads across BBC local radio stations and regional television programmes.   In addition, the unit's output has been used by BBC Wales, BBC Scotland, Good Morning Ulster and the Sunday Politics show.   The move to home-working brought about by the pandemic necessitated a switch from in-house secondments to remote learning.   From September to October, 2020, the SDU ran a pilot with local news partners offering remote training sessions in four key areas.  Around 70 local journalists benefited from the sessions.    The sessions took delegates through the basics of spreadsheets including how to sort, filter and pivot data using the web-based free application Google Sheets.  The second session included more advanced techniques including how to merge datasets using the VLOOKUP function.  The Freedom of Information masterclass took delegates through how to maximise use of the Act when making requests to local authorities including what to do when your request is denied.  Delegates who took Using Statistics in Journalism learned how to perform descriptive statistics on datasets, as well as learning some of the common pitfalls journalists fall into when using statistics in their work.   Many thanks    Pete Sherlock "," The portfolio we are putting forward for consideration demonstrates how the SDU used data to help explain the implications of the pandemic to a national and regional audience.  We told exclusive stories by bringing inaccessible datasets into the public domain.   Our portfolio also demonstrates a commitment to transparency and open reporting.  All our datasets, code and methodology are published on our Github page and shared across the industry.     These stories made headlines across the BBC's flagship news programmes, as well as across hundreds of local newspapers and regional television and radio outlets.   In April, we reported how hundreds of thousands of key workers considered critical to the UK’s response to the coronavirus crisis were earning below the so-called “real living wage”.   Later that month, we reported experts warning some airports were ""at risk"" of closure because of the loss of business during the coronavirus pandemic.   In May, we reported on fears that the UK's scene would collapse without government support, as the lockdown left 140,000 performers, agents, promoters and technicians without a steady income since the end of March.   Later that month, we told how search interest in online casinos had hit an all-time high in the UK since lockdown began.   In June, the unit told how some of the largest UK councils may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support.   In July, we reported how more than one in six young people are now claiming out-of-work benefits in some parts of the UK.   In August, we reported that flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable were falling, revealing the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme.   We also reported how thousands of landlords were trying to avoid renting their properties to benefit claimants, despite a judge ruling a blanket ban was unlawful.   In October 2020, we reported police had wrongly cancelled records of serious crimes, in many cases without informing victims   In November, we reported experts' fears that thousands of smaller charities across the UK could cease to exist in the new year, following a shift in the nature of giving.   In December, we reported millions of people missed out on potentially life-saving scans when non-Covid-19 NHS services almost ground to a halt during the pandemic.

United States,Vox,Small,Vox Covid-19 Data Coverage," To Whom It May Concern—   Wissam Rhayem, is a traveling emergency physician who splits his time between six hospitals in the southwest. Normally, it can take hours to transfer a patient from the small hospitals where he works in the western US to larger facilities with more resources. Now, even those are filling up with coronavirus patients.   Rhayem recently treated a 21-year-old who was on a cross-country family road trip when he got sick with COVID-19. “This kid ...” he trails off. “His heart stopped. We had gotten it pumping again, but he was paralyzed and intubated. I don’t think his Dad thought it was a real thing. I had to tell him that your son is probably not going to make it.”   As a journalist covering Covid-19, reporting on how the news impacts real people has never felt more important. But much of pandemic reporting has involved parsing data and finding visual ways to clearly and concisely communicate critical information. That's why I'm really proud of the Pulitzer-center supported collaboration that You You Zhou, a freelance data journalist, and I published this winter. The third piece in the series is You You Zhou's collaboration with Julia Belluz, a Vox staff writer.    As a freelancer, it's never been harder to place work: Many outlets' budgets have dried up, and quick-moving news cycles make working outside a newsroom even more challenging. That's another reason I'm submitting these pieces now. Despite the odds, they show a close attention to detail, and a commitment to using data to help convey complex topics in a comprehensible manner.   Many thanks in advance for your consideration!   Lois Parshley     "," The first of this series parses how mask use policies have impacted Covid-19 rates in various states. The second expands on that with original research conducted by online survey, finding where the general public was not adequately using masks. The third visually represents different states' approach to Covid-19 vaccinations. Together, they show a commitment to creatively using data to help make the pandemic more understable.  ",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19,https://www.vox.com/2020/12/15/21507630/pfizer-biontech-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-supply-states,https://www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hong Kong S.A.R., China",South China Morning Post,Big,South China Morning Post's Covid-19: our explanatory graphics collection," In the space of 10 years the South China Morning Post’s infographic desk has gone from two designers to the current team of seven visual journalists. The team has grown from researching, writing and designing standalone visual stories for print, to driving the Post’s whirlwind transition from local newspaper to world-class digital news media organisation.    The team’s exuberant, idiosyncratic and distinctive style has proven popular with readers. This might be best reflected by “Coronavirus: the disease Covid-19 explained'', the SCMP’s most-read story of 2020 and “The World of Languages'' from 2015, which remains one of the Post’s all time best-read stories.    Using a combination of traditional illustration and innovative design, the team is always on the lookout for new ways to express themselves and to telegraph ideas to readers. They use each new project as a fresh opportunity to experiment and evolve – their joyful creativity is clear for all to see.    Past and present members of the team form a veritable who’s who in the infographics world. This can be attested to by the revolving door of talent recruited from SCMP for influential positions at such world-leading corporations as National Geographic, Bloomberg and Reuters, as well as the numerous awards ceremonies and  international conferences to which the current team is invited to address. "," The first project in the collection was published on 21 January with the most recent on 28 September, 2020. Our first coronavirus data visualisation alerted the international community to the significance of an obscure disease from faraway Wuhan, China. Published within 24 hours of confirmation that the virus could be transmitted human-to-human we focused on the source of the outbreak and explained why Covid-19 would inevitably become a major worldwide health crisis. As the coronavirus grew from outbreak to epidemic and then to pandemic, we housed our growing library of visual explanatory stories in a single portfolio.   The SCMP was the first major news organisation to take Covid-19 seriously. Uneasy memories of SARS from 2003 were still fresh in the memories of Hongkongers which impelled us to publish ""Wuhan virus: a visual explainer"" before Covid-19 had been named and while the official toll consisted of just 291 infections and two deaths.    With much of the international media playing catch-up, readers turned to the SCMP to unravel the then mysterious coronavirus which propelled ""Covid-19 explained"" into SCMP's most-read story of 2020. <a href=""https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3047038/wuhan-virus/old/21january.html"">https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3047038/wuhan-virus/old/21january.html  We updated the story to ""Coronavirus: the disease Covid-19 explained"" as the coronavirus spread exponentially and included the first real-time tally of global infections and deaths. The code for the toll was used by many international publications on their own sites, gaining SCMP millions of additional clicks.    Adobe illustrator, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Brackets, Adobe Fresco, Procreate, Java Script, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Internal library, Node JS, LoopbackJS, MomentJS, QGIS, Google Spreadsheet, paper and pencil were used.   Data and information from Chinese authorities were collected on a Google Spreadsheet. Data from sources such as Johns Hopkins University, CDC, WHO, was scraped using NodeJs and stored in JSON files in our database before the JSON files were displayed using HTML. We also used vector diagrams, illustrations, video, photos and maps created with QGIS, which were exported as SVGs. Mockup and layouts were done with Adobe XD, Sketch BV; and paper and pencil.   When the coronavirus first broke out there was little consistency in how the international community counted infections and deaths. Many countries failed to include asymptomatic cases and others did not include victims who died from related causes. Some countries simply manipulated the case numbers. Collecting information from Chinese authorities is always difficult, with local and central authorities citing conflicting figures. As Johns Hopkins University emerged as the most reliable source, the 12-hour lag between Asia and America meant it was important for SCMP to independently source the numbers for Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and China to keep the numbers fresh. This made it difficult to create automatic data feeds and meant pivoting on the fly by updating the number manually throughout the day and night.   We have a small team of six visual journalists and one engineer dedicated to visual stories, so in order to keep on top of the constantly changing news we published regular updates and renosed stories so they could evolve as fresh information came to light. The distribution of tasks, such as the production of assets, development of the online site, sketches, ideas, research, writing and editing was shared among the team. This way we were able to meet deadlines and keep developing stories while working across multiple projects and looking for new ways to report the pandemic.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Manas Sharma portfolio,"The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. Manas Sharma has been instrumental in our progress in 2020, producing a number of striking examples which have pushed the boundaries of data journalism and visual storytelling. From building a COVID-19 epidemiological model from scratch to calculating the damage to the habitats of 1,400 animal species by the Australian bushfires.   This portfolio showcases some his best work, both from a data journalism perspective, such as his research and data scraping of all coronavirus research papers to deliver the ""Speed Science"" project, and also his innovative front end web development and production, like his presentation on the scale of Australia's bushfires, that offered readers a navigable and digestible experience breaking his complex data work into understandable insights for the reader.   Manas, 24, is based in Singapore, working with the graphics team in Asia but collaborating on global stories and data projects. ","   Stopping the spread    Building a herd immunity model    Manas’ role:      Research - key covid data points/parameters and the mathematics of model building  Coding - constructing the model using Javascript  Analysis - batch running thousands of simulations through the model to reveal key findings  Production - front-end web development, allowing the simulations to run in the browser and be placed in the story. An additional, reactive interactive model was added at the bottom of the page for readers to input their own values.    Reuters built an epidemic model to simulate how the coronavirus can spread within a population. We ran the model thousands of times to compare when “herd immunity” would kick in for various reproductive numbers and under a range of scenarios. The model enabled us to show readers what level of immunity would likely be required in order to stop the spread.         Anatomy of Singapore’s outbreak      Manas’ role:      Scraping data - from daily press releases  Handling data - cleaning, formatting, merging  Analysis - to see how clusters were forming and how to visualise  Production - Coding animations in WebGL    Manas transformed printed Covid-19 case data into a slick animation of Singapore's explosive worker dormitory clusters. The piece documents and explains how and where clusters formed. He used WebGL to enable the reader's computer and browser to seamlessly render more than 30,000 nodes.         Assessing Australia’s “ecological disaster”      Manas’ role:      All data research work - Find, collect, clean, format data  Analysis - Used QGIS and Node.js to batch process fire hotspot data, overlay on each habitat, find the intersecting area, and ultimately calculate how much habitat was burned for every individual species.  Production - Finalised data set EXCLUSIVE to Reuters, which could be used by others on the team for the visualisations on the page.    As environmental agencies and other news organisations  estimated  the environmental damage from fires, a Reuters data analysis of more than 1,400 species revealed the true extent of destruction. We processed massive amounts of satellite-derived fire data and habitat information. By calculating the intersection of those datasets we were able to reveal the animals hardest hit by bushfires.         Sizing up Australia’s bushfires     Manas’ role:   Building the interactive graphic and web page and wiring in the data   An innovative explanation of the unprecedented scale of fires burning in Australia. We built a ticker linked to the scroll of the page which counts area as you progress, overlaying small countries and cities to show true scale. This very effective and innovative format has since been replicated in other online fire visualisations.         Speed science: The risks of swiftly spreading coronavirus research      Manas’ role:      Data - collecting and scraping all scientific papers related to the new coronavirus  Analysis - running language analysis to find all papers of interest, authors, locations  Exporting graphics - that could be used in the presentation  Web page build    A Reuters analysis found that at least 153 studies – including epidemiological papers, genetic analyses and clinical reports – examining every aspect of the newly discovered (at the time) COVID-19 - have been posted or published since the start of the outbreak. These involved 675 researchers from around the globe. This was a huge increase compared to MERS and SARS research.   While speedy scientific analysis is highly useful if it's good, flawed or misleading science can sow panic and may make a disease epidemic worse by prompting false policy moves or encouraging risky behaviour.   One scientific post suggests links between the new coronavirus and HIV, a second says it may have passed to people via snakes, while a third claims it is a pathogen from outer space.

France,Agence France-Presse,Big,Covid-19 at Agence France-Presse: local and global datajournalism,"   Agence France-Presse (AFP) is a leading global news agency providing fast, comprehensive and verified coverage of the events shaping our world, drawing from a newsgathering network across 151 countries. AFP publishes stories, videos, photos and graphics in French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, and German.      In 2014, AFP's graphics department was joined by a team of data journalists and developers. Their mission was to create new interactive projects, databases and semi-automated content.       The team carried out several large projects, including a visual and interactive project about<a href=""https://interactive.afp.com/graphics/Stray-bullets_254""> victims of violence in Rio’s favelas , and a data journalism project about<a href=""https://interactive.afp.com/features/Une-femme-tous-les-trois-jours_597/""> femicides in France . It has also created tools for the newsroom. The nine-member team (four data journalists, two web designers, one database designer and two developers) is now joined every year by three students as part of a fellowship program involving young developers and data journalists.       2020 marked a big step forward for the data team as its work has become the centerpiece of our Covid-19 operations. The team set up three databases, including a general Covid-19 database and a more specific Covid Trends database to cover the path of the pandemic, which we are submitting for your consideration.       As other news organizations, the agency launched its most ambitious global data journalism project to cover the Covid-19 crisis. This has created a new data culture within the newsroom.      By submitting this collective effort to the Sigma Awards we hope to encourage our newsroom to further this effort. We do believe data journalism is crucial for the people’s right to know and thrives when it involves the kind of interactions we saw, involving “on the ground journalists” collecting the data and a specialized team able to support them and bring to light new stories.   ","We are submitting for your consideration our database of Covid cases and deaths, a second database created to follow Covid-19 Trends and the automated content they have generated, including our Data-driven videos; We are also presenting our lockdowns database, a portfolio of explicative datavizualisations and our public interactive graphics. The Covid-19 database was created on February 24 as our answer to a pressing question: what sources should we use ? We realized several bureaus were using different sources and databases. We also knwe we would not properly fulfil our mission as a major international news agency if we had to rely on other organizations databases: how would we vet the quality of the data ? How could we avoid missing major thresholds, updates, alerts ? Four data journalists, two web designers and one database specialist were appointed ""guardians"" of the base. They vetted the data and cleaned the base, calling bureaus and correcting mistakes when discrepancies were found. The main problem we face is how labour-intensive the database is to be able to m Our main base only relies on direct official sources, with one exception: for the United States, we use Johns Hopkins University tallies and cross-check them with the data provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Afghanistan, we use WHO data as there is no official data on a daily basis. We have created a second database to cover weekly trends and other long term data. Semi-automated text is generated at least once a day. Automated graphics are also created with a script editor which uses cases and deaths data and creates a ranking of worst-affected countries. Thanks to our Covid-19 databases AFP has been a reliable source for hundreds of media clients. Our tallies, threshold alerts and regional angles have made headlines across the world. We have produced over 16,000 Covid-related graphics delivered via satellite, FTP and our AFP.com platform. The number of downloads, which only reflects part of the metrics, shows high levels of use. 10, 496 graphics were downloaded in Spanish; 8,172 in English; 1,624 in French, 1,077 in German, 1,531 in Arabic and 202 in Portuguese from January 2020 to January 2021. Our AFP Interactive team also designed Data-driven videos (DDV), connected to the Covid database, which could generate 10 to 15 seconds videos featuring the number of cases and deaths for any given country, region or for the world. DDVs can be created by video or social media editors in just three clicks, without motion design or data skills. We built the tool using some of the technology developed with a Google DNI grant. In previous versions of the DDV, we created short videos for tweets and location. Covid-19 data was made available to the public via our AFP Interactive page in five languages (French, Spanish, English, German, Italian). The embeddable version of this interactive graphic has been viewed 96 million times since March 2020. In March and April, our documentation department also maintained a database to count the number of people under lockdown. To measure how the world had come to a halt we used four variables: mandatory lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, and ""people invited to stay at home"". To calculate the percentage of people invited or forced to stay at home, we used UN population projections for 2020. Our lockdown tallies made headlines in many countries. Our media clients could rely on us for timely data updates and therefore spend more time focusing on more specialized issues. We believe no other international news organization provided such a massive amount of Covid data texts, graphics and data-driven videos in six",https://spark.adobe.com/page/dX54j7sAgrnFf/,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JzbN4ZeYwLJmbYGqhIqApkp5UvnFnlJZo9ZT7F4Xtm0/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JzbN4ZeYwLJmbYGqhIqApkp5UvnFnlJZo9ZT7F4Xtm0/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,,,,
United States,FiveThirtyEight,Big,Elena Mejía portfolio," After years working at different newsrooms as a writer, fact-checker and researcher, I always felt something was missing. I loved reporting, finding new sources and connecting the dots for readers, but I craved the challenge of discovering more information that could be buried in numbers.            I studied at The University of Texas at Austin where I amassed clips as I wrote for multiple publications on everything related to Texas politics and public policy. I went to the Texas Capitol almost every day and covered legislative debates that would go on well into the night.  I then took a job as a researcher for Type Investigations, a nonprofit that produces long-form investigative projects. It only took a few Excel tasks with some formulas and pivot tables when I worked on a<a href=""https://theintercept.com/2018/04/18/in-30-years-only-17-women-won-sexual-harassment-claims-before-wall-streets-oversight-body/""> story  about sexual harassment in Wall Street for me to understand the importance of empirical evidence in journalism –– and the unmeasurable opportunity that came with it.            I started reading stories with large methodologies, bespoke graphics and many, many datasets. I learned about The Guardian’s data team after reading their investigation on<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study""> How American Moves Its Homeless . I admired the craft of map-making after following Reuters’<a href=""http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010051VB46G/index.html""> coverage  of the Rohingya crisis, and I followed FiveThirtyEight’s series<a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/""> The Gerrymandering Project , a viz-driven analysis that somehow managed to simplify an incredibly complex topic.            After receiving my acceptance letter at Columbia University for the MS in Data Journalism, my original goal was to learn how to analyze data and incorporate that with my journalism experience. Since I never gave myself an opportunity to experiment with visualization or design, I never thought I’d succeed as a visual journalist. I figured I would take the program’s only data visualization class to learn more about it, but otherwise focus mainly on analysis, as I had carefully planned.            It took just one visuals class to completely change the career path I thought I would strictly follow. I spent hours selecting the right colors, the best chart forms and crafting visual cues to better explain what I was trying to say in my writing. I studied data teams from different newsrooms and compared their styles, and tried incorporating some techniques for better design in my own work. The conversations I enjoyed the most with one of my data professors, Jonathan Soma, wasn’t that much about the data behind the story, but how best I could make sure readers would leave with at least one takeaway after looking only at the graphics. I was skeptical about applying to data visualization jobs, but my teachers pushed me because they were convinced my projects were good enough.            They were right. I got hired at FiveThirtyEight as an associate visual journalist. After only one visuals class and virtually no design experience, I became a part of one of the best teams of graphics and interactives. In only six months, I sketched, designed and coded our series on the presidential and vice-presidential debates, another project on how the electoral college has changed, and even contributed to FiveThirtyEight’s 2020 Election Forecast in collaboration with other web developers on my team. I created static graphics for our politics, sports, and science platforms, and even experimented with abstract design to show COVID-19 spread in Thanksgiving.            I intend to continue learning about the art of visualizing data, striving to find new ways to help readers understand important issues, elevating storytelling with thoughtful design, and giving an audience more tools to help make informed decisions. I enjoy the challenge of finding new visual ways to communicate findings in data, and I no longer feel like something is missing. ","     <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/   We created a guide to election night to show how initial returns could be misleading. I designed and coded an interactive that would allow readers to navigate through different states and learn more about when polls would close, the potential shift in results, and their timing.       <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-final-debate-poll/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-final-debate-poll/   We polled voters before and after debates to look at the potential impact these had upon viewers’ opinions of the candidates. I helped craft the questions for voters, created different chart forms and worked in front-end development. I had to design graphics always thinking about the “before” and “after”, a challenge I addressed by designing histograms with clear outlines, slope charts and a waffle chart form that used legends and change in color for an “after” effect.       <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/   I created graphics using a blue-red gradient to enhance the battleground swings year by year and highlight the bigger and smaller changes in margin. The biggest challenge was figuring out how to apply the gradient to the lines in d3.js, and how to implement the arrows for the annotations for better design.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/   The biggest challenge for this story was coming up with a visual strategy that could best drive readers through a complex analysis with different variables. I opted for a waffle chart map to show diversity in the suburbs while avoiding substantial grey areas in a choropleth map. I also designed callouts in a beeswarm to merge variables without overwhelming the reader and worked with labeling to avoid confusion.        <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/   The multiple line chart needed multiple annotations and labels, so I experimented with different colors, opacities and dotted lines to create smart design without overwhelming readers with a packed graphic.           <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-even-a-small-thanksgiving-is-dangerous/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-even-a-small-thanksgiving-is-dangerous/   This is one of the most challenging graphics I’ve done. We wanted to create a transmission scenario that could be applied to virtually any city or state, regardless of specific COVID-19 transmission rates. I overcame this challenge by using Illustrator as my main tool, experimenting with different shapes and color palettes until I landed the final product.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-post-office-became-a-political-football/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-post-office-became-a-political-football/   For this story, I opted for bar charts to show both the positive and negative values and easily mark the months affected by COVID-19. I decided to flip both bar charts to help readers better understand the big difference between percent change in both services to the year prior, using color-coding for positive and negative values.        <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-redistricting-is-up-for-grabs-in-2020-here-are-the-races-to-watch/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-redistricting-is-up-for-grabs-in-2020-here-are-the-races-to-watch/   I created maps where states were sized by the number of congressional districts states would have after the 2020 census. The different-sized states presented challenges when it came to positioning in a way that would not hugely compromise their geographic location.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/   I used data to show how voter registration dropped dramatically in some states during the pandemic. I experimented with percent change from the 2016 election and other strategies to maintain the same y-axis across all states, but California and Texas undermined the changes in other states. I overcame this challenge by adjusting each chart to its own axis, effectively showing how voter registration dropped dramatically since 2016, no matter how big or small the state in question is.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Rebecca Pazos," I am the leading journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team and the newsroom advocate for data storytelling. I have worked with the team for more than five years and dedicate my time to developing new and creative ways to tell news stories.   My goal is to go beyond just using data in my stories, something I have been passionate about for the last eight years. I want to bring back humanity and emotion into my data storytelling.   Covid-19 has forced us to reflect deeply on our data reporting methods. As our audience demanded more real-time data and analysis, it was ever present in my mind the need to humanise the data because every number represents real people who are suffering. Delicately balancing objective data reporting with memorable and emotional visual content is an ongoing dream for me. My mentor and editor, Xaquin Gonzalez Veira has said:   ""This year’s COVID-19 epidemic was a difficult test for data journalists. Early in the pandemic, Rebecca showed impressive reflexes as she quickly established the paper’s data guidelines and sources. She also led the Data and Visual coverage with stories like ""Slowing the spread in Asia ’ or ‘ How the world lost 1 million lives to Covid-19 ’. Besides. pitching, reporting, writing, and conceiving the visuals, she also coordinated the designers and developers —while working remotely, a testament to her abilities.""    I have also crafted the workflow from the pitching process through to post-publication reports for our team which help us analyse what went well and what could have been done better for each project. This has led to an improved feedback loop so we can all learn from past mistakes - and wins too.   Over the past year, I have also taken much joy in mentoring interns. They all remain in contact and have communicated to me their shift towards more data-driven journalism as a direct result of working with our team and under my guidance.   I have conducted data workshops for the newsroom and universities and I am currently undertaking my own Masters in visual tools with the University of Girona to finally take my first steps into coding and sharpen my creative side.   I have not entered my own portfolio before but 2020 was a year filled with big news and was an important one for data storytelling ""with empathy"", something I think I'm acutely aware of.     "," My main skills rely on data reporting and data storytelling. I also used organisational skills to co-ordinate the immense efforts of producing daily-updated graphics for Covid-19, GE2020 and even the US elections.   I practice integrated visual journalism so it is crucial to work with all the visuals and text elements at the same time when constructing the pieces so that the story can seamlessly flow from beginning to end. I focus most of my energy on the top 25 per cent of all my stories, the ""above-the-fold"" for digital pieces, as this is where the majority of readers focus runs out. The rest of the story is usually littered with rewards or 'easter eggs' for the readers who have stuck with it and are more likely to read through to the end.   My portfolio is data-driven with a focus on getting across the 'right' message that is sensitive and empathetic.   These projects are a sign of progressive improvement. Every project I do, I look back on and would change a million things. I hope it can be seen that my work is still in development and, perhaps positively, I'd like to think, always will be. I evolve with each project I do, hoping to further use data to contextualise human stories.    For the last project of 2020 that takes a look back at one year of Covid-19, my hope was to leave a strong message against the many naysayers of movement restriction measures but to also highlight the incredible intricacy of these measures for people who come from a lower socio-economic background. Living in Singapore, we are highly poised to raise the voices of our neighbouring countries who might be doing poorly with stay-at-home or social distancing measures.    Also, for politically difficult topics, we are able to use data in a way that addresses issues, for example the historical boundaries story dealt with gerrymandering in Singapore, in an objective yet beautiful way.

Jordan,"Daraj, Amman Net, Al Ghad, Roya, Maqalat, ARIJ*/]squarespace.com",Small,"Data for Change, Jordan"," Internews’ Data Journalism Certification Program in Jordan was the first in-depth data journalism training program offered in the Middle East and North Africa and produced the country’s first batch of of data literate local public interest journalism published throughout Jordanian media. The training manual produced for the course is now hosted as an open source resource by the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) and is being used to train aspiring data journalists across the region.     Throughout the program, journalists learned to harness data to cover critical issues related to socioeconomic reforms, local governance, and human rights by applying an inquiry-based approach to cover education inequality, violence against women, mismanagement of water and renewable energy resources, unsustainable aid to Syrian refugees and more. Participants used the growing amount of available socioeconomic data (open data since the government would not respond to FOIA requests) about Jordan to create news and feature content that more effectively engages audiences on topics important to Jordanians.    Jordan’s media is highly partisan, public trust of media is low and freedom of the press is declining, which is why these stories came at a crucial time. This program sought out young professionals that were passionate about challenges facing their communities and bringing evidence-based explanatory reporting to tackle society’s most pressing issues. Like in much of the region and the world, the pandemic offered the government an opportunity to further restrict press freedom under the guise of its emergency response. Journalists seized the opportunity to instead of tackling corruption straight on, highlight the weak public service systems that existed long before the current crisis and engaged the public in a conversation about solutions.     Media houses were reluctant to publish accountability reporting yet these stories ran across mainstream media and in online media houses targeting younger audiences as well. Journalists showed examples from regional stars including InfoTimes, Inkyfada and Al Jazeera to demonstrate to editors the value of incorporating data-driven content into their digital convergence strategy. Mentors from InfoTimes and 7iber also helped journalists craft powerful storytelling packages.     Even though the program has ended, ARIJ, AmmanNet and Daraj have continued to commission and publish data stories by alumni.   "," Stories published in mainstream media focused on the issue of inequality. The major challenge for all of the stories was the dearth of data. Jordan has extremely weak FOIA laws. Though we requested over a dozen of disaggregated data sets over the course of the year, the most we received were summary tables, if we received a response at all. Editors were also reluctant to publish stories criticizing the government, though they were more willing to do so once they learned that the stories were backed by the limited data that the government had made public. Many media outlets required direct guidance by our team in how to publish embedded visualizations and none were either able or willing to share metrics on story performance. Many stories also ran as a podcast in Arabic.        Gender Inequality       Despite having achieved gender equality at most levels of education, Jordan's women are still laregely absent from the job market and these stories look at the systemic reasons behind Jordan's persistent gender inequality. <a href=""https://ammannet.net/english/jordanian-women-want-tech-more-tech-industry-wants-them"">Jordanian Women Want Tech More than Tech Want them  published by AmmanNet and as a <a href=""https://www.maqalat.me/articles/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B6%D8%B9%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B1%D8%BA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%86"">podcast  debunks a belief that women do not work in tech because they do not pursue STEM education, when women in fact match men in STEM degrees. <a href=""https://alghad.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AE%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%81/"">Education Associated with Less Domestic Violence but Fails to Break Culture of Silence , published in Al Ghad newspaper, explores how the education level of men and women correlates with incidence and reporting of gender based violence.

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Tom Calver," To whom it may concern   I'd like to submit the attached data journalism portfolio for your consideration. I am proud to have worked on dozens of agenda-setting exclusives in 2020.   I am the Senior Data journalist at The Times and The Sunday Times which I joined in January 2019, having arrived via BBC News and Which?. My job involves everything from building charts and interactives to working on front-page investigations.   My toolkit for the past year has included:     The R programming language and its amazing online community;   A passion for explaining challenging concepts and bringing them to life;   My eye for a story that will get people talking;   Extremely talented colleagues with whom I can bounce ideas off.    Thank you for considering my application,   Tom ","I hope my portfolio shows my full range of data journalism skills with a wide variety of different pieces. I've included some explainers, like my piece on why measuring the Covid death toll was so hard. At the time, in early April amid the novelty and confusion of the lockdown, many of the concepts that are now sadly part of the national vocabulary like excess deaths, were not widely understood. My challenge was to explain these ideas to readers in a visual way, and to show why data cannot often be taken at face value. The piece had the highest engagement of any published that week, suggesting I was successful. I've also included an interactive tool which I led on, came up with the idea, sourced most of the data and oversaw its production. Our ""when will you get the Covid vaccine?"" was one of our most-searched interactives ever, and told our readers when they might expect to get the vaccine based on their age, location, and any underlying health conditions they had. However, the part of my job that gives me the most satisfaction is being able to invoke real change through agenda-setting investigations. I worked on dozens of Covid stories, scrutinising NHS Test and Trace, exposing a tech flaw in the ""world beating"" app that meant it was set at the wrong sensitivity for a whole month, and producing a calculator telling readers where they are in the vaccine queue. I also produced a piece of analysis in June that sh However, I'm particularly proud of my front-page investigation into the national lottery. I revealed how children as young as 16 were able to gamble up to £350 a week on online ""instant-win"" games. With titles like ""Treasure Temple"" and ""Fruity £500s"", they appeared geared towards teenagers. Although 16 year-olds have been allowed to buy lottery tickets since its inception in 1994, the lottery has changed beyond recognition. Through analysing company accounts, I showed how lottery operator Camelot's profit grew drastically from soaring sales of scratchcards and instant-win games. These are more profitable to the operator, and also give less money to charity. I am delighted that since the story was published, the government has confirmed that it will raise the minimum playing age from 16 to 18 as part of its review of the Gambling Act. In another story I'm particularly proud of, I reported how developers were exploiting planning laws to convert empty banks, takeaways and barbers into tiny flats, prompting fears that high streets would turn into ""slum housing"". Permitted development rights, which had until recently been associated with converting offices into flats, had extended to shops and takeaways. New planning reforms would have made this process even easier. Analysing energy performance certificate data which lists the floor size of every new-build home, I noticed that some of the smallest were registered on high streets. One of the tiniest, converted from an electrical store in Southampton, was barely bigger than a jail cell but had more expensive rent per square foot than an average Islington house. Its inhabitant said it felt like she was living in a ""pod"". Using data from planning portals, I found dozens of approved applications to convert shops into flats, many since Britain went into lockdown. Experts suggested Covid had accelerated the residential takeover of the high street. Using floor plans, with the help of the graphics department, I brought the story to life visually One month later, the housing secretary conceded that all permitted development homes must meet the national minimum space standard of 37㎡.

Russia,"Tinkoff Journal, Ria Novosti, The Village, IStories",Big,Alexey Smagin portfolio," When I was a kid I was a big fan of mobile games. I dreamed to become a programmer and make the best game humanity ever played.    When I was 14 I became the chief editor of the online magazine about mobile games. It called MobiTree and you can read it here: https://issuu.com/mobitree/docs/issue_7.    Since that journalism was everywhere in my life. I was studying Computer Science in university but also was a reporter and then chief editor of the university's newspaper.   When the time came to choose my profession I have known about Data Journalism — the field where I can use both my reporting and programming skills. I made my first data-story when I was as student — in December, 2017. I changed 4 big newsrooms (former RBC, Novaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti Infographics Team and now Tinkoff Journal) and worked as freelancer with The Bell, The Village, IStories and more.    Data jounalism in Russia is on the beginning of it's way. Most of reporters can't even sort data in Excel and media editors doesn't understant why they need a data jountalist in their newsroom. I graduated in 2019 and I'am 24 years old now, but I'm a guest lecturer in Higher School of Economics and help young journalists to make their way in Data journalism and Data visualisation.   It's hard to do Data Journalism in Russia because there is no experienced colleagues and nobody can help you to do your first steps. And there is often no team to grow you with: now I am the only Data journalist in Tinkoff Journal.   But I love this way. I think Data jounalism is cool because it can help you to investigate the things other journalists can't do. I also the big fan of Data visualistion — it can be beautiful and it can evoke many emotions in readers. There is many creation in my work and I can spend hours to invent different forms to present the data. "," At the beginning of 2020 I was a Data Analyst in Ria Novosti Infographics Team. We made a beautiful visual explainer to 'Oscar Bait' phenomenom. We discovered that most of Oscar 'Best Picture' winners since 1990 have the greatest Oscar Bait score. It probably means that Oscar-wiining films doesn't have to be really great. It's simply enough that they satisfy jury tastes.  My part of work: Idea, Text, Data Analysis, Inforgraphic Prototypes  https://ria.ru/20200207/1564342281.html?language=en    Then I moved to Tinkoff Jounal to became first data jounalist in team. There we made an investigation about teachers' and doctors' salaries in russian budget. We discovered that salaries in vacancies are two times lower that in official statistics.   https://journal.tinkoff.ru/pedstat/  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/medstat/    I made a lot of works as author, data analyst and infographics designer. I also made my first steps in D3.js interactive visualisation. For example. I made this maps in our stories about heating and watering in Russia (mobile version graphics are not maps so look at them from desktop):  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/teplo-stat/  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/vodopoy/    I also did some work as freelanser that i love. With IStories data editor Alesya Marohovskaya we did a scrollytilling explainer about falsifications on russian elections. It helped our readers to understand complicated statistics.  https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/  That was the first time Flourish used with the scrollytelling in Russia so I did a lesson how to do the same:  https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/    The second work I did as freelanser was the collaboration with The Village. I searched the prices of medical masks that profiteers have published in Telegram chats (thousands of messages) and made the visualisation. My little data investigation became a part of the story:  https://www.the-village.ru/city/ustory/379695-spekulanty-1-maski   And the teaching was the big part of my work in 2020. I had two courses in Higher School of Economisc: Data Jounalism and Data Visualisation. I have all the materials — presentations, data and tasks stored at GitHub. Courses' programs and tasks was developed by my own.    https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_datajourn_2020  https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_dataviz_2020 ",https://ria.ru/20200207/1564342281.html?language=en,https://static.istories.media/iframes/f8f44a6c61c24fddb39cd35aa914e9d4/landing/,https://www.the-village.ru/city/ustory/379695-spekulanty-1-maski,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/teplo-stat/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/series/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/vodopoy/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/pedstat/,https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/,https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_datajourn_2020,https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_dataviz_2020,,,,
Spain,elDiario.es,Big,elDiario.es: Covid-19 coverage," elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide.  Launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it - just a bunch of journalists and their savings - elDiario.es has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. Among the dozens of new digital projects born in the past decade in Spain, elDiario.es stands out.  More than 12M unique users per month (ComScore Mmx) now read eldiario.es and that figure grows every month. And elDiario.es is the most widely read native digital media outlet in Spain, according to the Spanish Sociological Research Center.  The key business innovation is the 'membership program' - more than 60.000 people (""socios"") already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence. But it is not a paywall: the ""socios"" of elDiario.es do not pay to read the news, they pay for the information to be freely spread and thus gain social impact. They pay to belong to a community of citizens sharing values like equality, democratization, social justice and more importantly, the need for independent journalism.   Our business model has remained the same since our foundation, but when coronavirus crisis hit, the media experienced financial difficulties. In order to handle this situation,  we decided to bearly change our business model and make an evolution of it always keeping our foundational principles: elDiario.es will continue to be free for those who cannot pay but it will be necessary to be a member to read elDiario.es regularly.    In a world where manipulation and propaganda advance, we do not want our journalism to be left behind a wall that excludes people based on their income. This evolution in our business model has brought to our community 18,000 new members and thousands of existing readers stepped in.  Thanks to them elDiario.es is also a profitable company. Nowadays, our community represents more than 50% of our annual income. And in order to be fully transparent with their contribution, we annually publish our financial accounts. This good practice has become an expected date for the audience who perceives us as a trustful and reliable newsroom.  Since its inception, elDiario.es opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. Now, the data journalism team is formed by 3 journalists.   This year, our Covid-19 coverage proves that this team has had a public service role. First, using data analysis, interactive narrative, and visualization of complex issues to make them understandable, and second, as an early warning of the evolution of the epidemic for our readers. In fact, the 5 most read pieces of news of the year in elDiario.es were created by the data team: our covid trackers. Precisely, our work philosophy has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the newsroom to search stories and do better journalism.    "," *Some of our included pieces appear as published in 2021 (our trackers) because we are still updating them but they were originally published in 2020   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the greatest health, mortality and economic crisis in the last century. For the first time, millions of people in all countries have been watching  numbers and data day after day.  This is the coverage since February 2020 of the data team of elDiario.es (formed by Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz and Victòria Oliveres) of the greatest mortality crisis of the century in Spain and the world. All the pieces that integrate this portfolio have been working from home since March 2020 from 3 different cities, even that challenge the result of the work has been rewarding and useful to the public.   This portfolio started with the data tracker since the first confirmed cases in China, the arrival of the virus in Europe through Italy and Spain continues and finally with the expansion to the rest of the countries of the world.   During these 6 months of pandemic, we have updated and explained day after day the visualizations of the evolution of cases and deaths in Spain and the world prioritazing the understanding and facilitating usability by users.  We have also done great visual reports and in-depth analysis. For example, on how the death toll from the coronavirus crisis is much higher than the death toll according to official records: we compare the mortality figures for 2020 with those of the last 45 years, revealing the excess mortality of more than 68,000 people over the historical average.  Furthermore, the analysis and explanations go beyond the health issue and we have focused on all the thematic axes and consequences of the pandemic: we analyze the destruction of employment, the inequality of contagion between rich and poor and the drama of collapse of nursing homes, which were abandoned in the worst of the pandemic.  This work prioritized the public service to our readers, so we have also made outreach visualizations to explain the effects of social distancing to avoid contagion, an interactive map so that everyone could know how far they could walk according to the rules during the confinement or information to alert of the situation of the epidemic at all times.  We also created a unique database of confirmed cases by municipality (information that we update every week) in Spain, consulting, one by one, the 17 autonomous communities (states) of the country. This map serves the population as an early warning indicator to know how the situation is in their city. Precisely, this database, not published by the Government of Spain, demonstrates the effort of this data team to make up for the absence of a data publication policy by the authorities, thus having to create homogeneous indicators, correct wrong data supplied, errors in the figures and dealing with the lack of coordination to publish the figures of the epidemic.  Our coverage of the coronavirus was not based on creating visually striking graphics but on counting the data explaining its meaning and the limitations it had in the simplest possible way. For example, we visualized how the coronavirus curve was flattening in Spain with interactive explanations, the reasons behind why there were so few deaths in summer even though the cases had skyrocketed or how the Government published the death figures with Covid-19 with long delay.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Ellis Simani," My path to working at ProPublica as a data reporter was kick-started in 2017 when I participated in ProPublica’s Data Institute, a 12-day intensive workshop on how to use data, design and code for journalism. At that point, I had interned at small news sites, and taken a handful of economics and computer sciences courses in college, but hadn’t yet combined the two interests professionally. The data institute gave me a solid foundation in how to report, design and build interactive graphics and data-driven news applications, but more importantly, it instilled the confidence that I could carve out a path for myself in the industry.   After completing the institute, I spent a summer working as an intern with the Seattle Times’ news apps team, building interactive graphics and news applications. Having been born and raised in Seattle, it had always been a goal of mine to work for my hometown paper, and the opportunity solidified my appreciation for hard-hitting local news. I worked on everything from building internal tools for reporters and editors, to working alongside reporters to visualize data for investigative projects. The highlight of my summer was contributing to a front-page story on the widespread use of toxic pesticides in many Seattle parks.   After my internship ended, I moved to Los Angeles, where I joined the L.A. Times as a fellow with the data visualization desk as part of the Minority Editorial Training Program (Metpro). During my year and a half at the paper, I worked on a variety of ambitious and informative projects that pushed my skills as a journalist and visual storyteller, while sharpening my ability to work quickly and creatively in a fast-paced breaking news environment. I covered everything from visualizing sea level rise on the California coast, to scrutinizing the racial and ethnic categories available on the Census. But what I enjoyed most was delving deep into data and taking the time and effort to find investigative stories that impacted our readers and held California leaders accountable. This interest is what encouraged me to return to ProPublica as a fellow in 2019.   My work from last year is a product of the skills that I’ve developed since attending the data institute in 2017, when I was just beginning to take the plunge into this corner of the industry. When I reflect on the work I did in 2020, I’m able to see how my professional experiences prepared me to jump from interrogating messy datasets, to building interactive graphics and news apps, to tackling competitive, fast-moving stories on tight deadlines when the time called for it. But what I’m most proud of is how all of the stories I worked on are rooted in using data as a tool to empower the public with access to knowledge and to hold those in power accountable. "," In January of last year, my colleagues and I published “Credibly Accused,” the first public database of clergy who have been listed as credibly accused of sexual abuse in reports released by Catholic dioceses and religious orders in the United States. We built the tool by collecting data from nearly 180 sources – some were simple lists of names in text documents and others were entire webpages. I led the data reporting efforts on the project; spearheading the compilation, cleaning and standardization of the data, and also assisted in the development of the tool itself. On top of that, I co-reported an investigation into the lists, highlighting the lack of transparency and several inaccuracies in the documents published by church leaders. More than half a million people used our tool in the first week after publication and it would go on to become one of the 25 most-read ProPublica stories in 2020.   Two months later, the coronavirus pandemic quickly began spreading across the United States and unemployment skyrocketed, leaving millions of Americans uncertain how they would make rent payments, or pay credit card bills and their other debts. My colleague, Jeff Ernsthausen, and I understood that evictions would soon become a central issue facing the millions of renters in the country, and we decided to build our own database of court records to report on the topic. This work served as the foundation for several of the stories I worked on.   The first effort focused on landlords violating the CARES Act’s eviction ban by moving to evict renters at federally backed properties. Our reporting found more than a hundred illegal eviction filings at dozens of properties in the first few weeks after the law was passed by Congress. As a result of our reporting, landlords dismissed more than a hundred illegally filed cases, keeping those families in their homes as the pandemic raged.   For our second project, we combined several datasets to build an interactive database to help renters find out if they were protected from eviction. Later, as the CARES Act was set to expire, we published another story exploring the overall efficacy of the legislation in keeping renters in their homes, finding that the law was largely effective, and had caused evictions at covered properties to plummet in the middle of the summer.   But as vital legal and financial protections began to expire, court records showed that some landlords and debt collectors returned to court to squeeze money from those who didn’t pay. I wanted to dive deeper into how this dynamic was unfolding at the local level, and the next two investigations I worked on uncovered how two uniquely punitive practices impacted renters in Arkansas and debtors in Indiana during the pandemic.   Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. that allows landlords to file criminal charges against tenants for falling behind on rent. Our investigation into the practice found that dozens of tenants have been sentenced to jail in recent years under the law, and hundreds of the criminal cases were filed by landlords during the pandemic. A deputy prosecutor quoted in the story told us: ""I hate that law. It's unconstitutional."" In the weeks after our story ran, he was fired.   The final story I worked on uncovered that an Indiana school district had filed nearly 300 lawsuits against parents during the pandemic, many for unpaid textbook fees. After being reached for comment, the district announced that it would forgive the fees of one family mentioned prominently in the story and seek to vacate the small claims judgment filed against her.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Digital Story Innovations team," The ABC’s Digital Story Innovations team is a collection of journalists, developers, a designer and social media and video specialists. The team is focussed on data-driven, visual storytelling for Australian audiences.   Since its inception, we’ve used data to investigate and visualise stories on a broad range of issues from internment camps in remote China, devastating bushfires, how the Catholic school system takes from the poor to give to the rich and the wide reaching impact of climate change.    The DSI team’s 2020 portfolio showcases how data-driven techniques can be used across the full spectrum of story creation -- from discovery to research, analysis and presentation -- to either break new terrain or deepen public understanding of familiar topics.   The portfolio demonstrates how innovative storytelling techniques - such as data-driven investigation, graphics and interactive design - can be seamlessly blended with traditional person-centred storytelling to powerful effect.    It includes ground-breaking investigations based on leaked data (Catholic schools), exclusive access to tightly-held datasets (sexual assault, water theft), in-depth analyses of spatial datasets (the Arctic, water theft) as well as innovative use of publicly available datasets (coronavirus stories).   Each project demonstrates a commitment to rigorous, meaningful and transparent use of data while being unique in concept and execution. "," By combining innovative data mining, blending and analysis with compelling visual storytelling, our team is able to deliver investigative and explanatory journalism in a way that breaks down the complex nature of many of the topics.   Using water flow modelling data we revealed to our readers the disappearance of trillions of litres of water from Australia’s most vital network of rivers. We also analysed and visualised decades worth of water level data captured from both satellites and river gauges to show the devastating impact of drought on communities across Australia.   We were able to transport our audience to the remote environment of the Arctic Circle using spatial and climate data, to walk them through the effects climate change is having on the polar sea ice. A key goal was to ensure readers came away with a clear sense of why the stories were important and how they have been affected.   With “Rough justice”, the challenge was two-fold: first, obtaining multiple datasets from different police jurisdictions; and secondly, reconciling these disparate datasets to produce a coherent, accurate and meaningful national picture.   Our reporter negotiated for more than a year to obtain this exclusive data for every jurisdiction. In some instances, it involved informal collaboration with police commanders and police statisticians. In others, we were only able to obtain the requested data after applying pressure through backchannels. We then worked with two independent teams of experts to create a  framework for “mapping” dozens of police investigation outcomes across these crime classification systems.   “How the Catholic school system takes from the poor to give to the rich” combined leaked data from Catholic system insiders with finance figures scraped from the My School website. The My School dataset provides a more detailed picture of school income and expenditure than any publicly available data but is among the most tightly-held datasets in Australian education history.   Combining these datasets allowed us to calculate how the Catholic system’s secret funding formula impacted every school in the system. First, we extracted the secret funding formula by manually measuring the axes and data points in a series of scatterplots presented in the leaked documents. (The data used to create these scatterplots was not contained in the documents.) Next, we used the My School data to recreate the scatterplots as an interactive chart with “live data”. Lastly, we built a database to allow users to search for a school and individual results.   Our team has also led the ABC’s collection and analysis of domestic coronavirus statistics, maintaining a database that tracks key information about Australia’s fight against Covid-19.   Maintaining this database is not a straightforward exercise. The data is separately compiled and held by each of Australia’s eight state and territory health departments, plus the federal health department. Each uses its own definitions, protocols and processes. Combining this data into a national dataset that allows meaningful comparisons across the jurisdictions is a daily battle that requires forensic interrogation of multiple disparate datasets and  intimate understanding of the  methodology behind each one. To ensure the highest standards of data integrity we work closely with each of the nine health departments plus a network of researchers, physicians and public health experts.    With the data collection aspect being so labour intensive, we needed to streamline other parts of the reporting process. This led us to the idea of a semi-automated story, with “custom words” pulled from a central database maintained in Google sheets.    The story is constantly evolving, with visualisations and analysis added, expanded or removed as needed. It remains a vital resource for the public for up-to-date, accurate data about the pandemic.

Finland,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi,Big,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi Data Desk Portfolio," Helsingin Sanomat has been pushing the envelope in Nordic digital journalism for years. The data desk team has been essential in turning around the previously ailing newspaper into a digital success, both journalistically and business-wise. The team collaborates with the rest of the editorial room on data and visual projects. The team features experts in software development, data journalism, robojournalism, and visual design. In 2020 the team was leading the way in Covid-19 reporting, for example in turning official data into easily accessible open data, but there was time also for other investigative and data projects.  "," These are short descriptions of the portfolio projects:    Covid-19 Tracking Project: Right from the beginning of the pandemic we started to collect Covid-19 data by hand to our database and also publish that data as open-source API for everyone to use. The project has had huge impact on two fronts: informing the public and in creating a new kind of open-source culture in journalism. Our stories have been read millions of times during the pandemic and the open-source API has been used not only by our competitors but by EU authorities as well.    Viime viikon kala: This investigative story looked into the quality of fresh fish that is being sold in the supermarkets. Lab tests showed that 25 % of the fish was not of good quality.    Missä he ovat nyt: In 2015 Finland saw over 30 000 asylum seekers coming to Finland. This story investigates what has happened to these people.     Naisten vuoro: We wanted to see how the role and share of women in Finnish film industry has changed during the years.

China,NetEase Datablog,Small,Netease DataBlog," Netease DataBlog is one of the pioneers in data journalism of China. It has been deeply engaged in the data journalism field for nine years which is considered as a media of great influence both in industry and academia. We commit to events sorting in logic and information mining in depth, presenting stories to audience in forms of infographics, H5, interactive charts and data maps by extensive auxiliary information.   Since the establishment of DataBlog, we have been actively working on stories about issues in social, economic, cultural, health, environmental, etc, for which we have received positive responses, including our follow-up stories on COVID-19.   DataBlog covers stories in all fields, and we could always present accurate interpretation from an appropriate and attractive perspective regardless of topic selections.   And for this very reason, data journalism is a niche in China though, the work of DataBlog could always achieve ideal communication effects. And now we are the column with the most followers among all peers in China. The amount of our audience is over 13 million.   Presently, our team consists of two editors and a designer. And we share a strong as well as impressive style no matter in content or in visualization. As a newsroom in small scale, now we applied for the 2nd Sigma Data Journalism Award. And We hope to learn from other workers in competition. "," Serises stories on COVID-19 is packaged into a portfolio for the competition.   Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, DataBlog acted instantly, and we are one of the earliest data journalism columns in China to cover revelant stories. In the early stage of the outbreak, the crowd knows little about coronavirus. By combing the epidemic data published by the government, we collected 129 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with complete or partial patient information including gender, age, infection symptoms and medicial state of the patients to partially present the basic picture of the epidemic to our audience as much as possible.   In addition, we made other tries. 33 days after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, the epidemic spreaded across the country. We decided to use SVG data map to inform readers the spread trajectory of the epidemic during the 33 days.   Besides, in another work of ours "" Cases Across   Four Generations  : How 527 Cluster Epidemics Spread "", we conducted statistics on the temporal and spatial span of the spread of cluster epidemics in China, the proportion of cases in three or four generations, the propagation algebra and more to warn the public of the necessity of not clustering during the epidemic period.   Except for COVID-19, medical resource is also within our concerns. At the beginning of the outbreak, we investigated on statistics about the use of beds and the change of bed occupancy rate in designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients in Wuhan, on the one hand; On the other hand, we have worked with a pressure meter for medical care in various cities in Hubei, calling for people to pay attention to the state of medical pressure in other cities in Hubei.   It is worth mentioning that we are getting more diversified in such exploration of topic selection about COVID-19. We not only focus on the coronavirus itself, but also pay more attention to how the people should live that affected by the COVID-19.   On January 23, 2020, Wuhan started lockdown for COVID-19. We found the Weibo hashtag ""Diary of the lockdown"" where plain people would record their dailylife and feelings. We analyzed the content of these diaries and restored the life of everyone with it after the lockdown.   Additionally, in "" Delivery Guy Tells   Secrets Behind the Lockdown in Wuhan "", we cooperated with the takeaway platform to peek into the living conditions of Wuhan people under the lockdown through takeaway orders, and found that the routine of people had alterd though, their taste remained. At the same time, we also found that many orders were sent to hospitals, many of which were from other address entrusting concern for people in Wuhan.   This is the introduction to the COVID-19 serises stories covered by DataBlog. We hope it will be of help for you to understand our work.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Reuters portfolio," Reuters tell their most important stories visually. Many pieces follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is unique data gathering techniques, charting and data walk-throughs, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations.     Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories.      Making data understandable   One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories.  Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining the various strains of Covid-19, combines complicated subject matter and a granular database to clearly explain how the virus has evolved.     Public service   Getting timely information about the spread of the coronavirus and putting the mountain of statistics the pandemic generates in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our COVID-19 Global Tracker leverages Reuters’ global reporting power to create one of the timeliest and in-depth coronavirus dashboards available. Readers can see global and regional trends, dig deep into their own country, or read the hundreds of headlines generated by our algorithm, fed by constantly changing data.   Another example is the “Shielded” series of data investigations, which show how an obscure legal doctrine called qualified immunity protects police accused of excessive force.     Innovative reporting techniques   The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. A number of striking examples of this are evident in our coverage of the Australia and California wildfires.     Innovative storytelling   The team are constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our project on herd immunity for example. A custom-built model simulates the impact of social distancing measures and calculates herd immunity thresholds.     Strong emphasis on project design   Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story.  Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word.  The design and feel of each piece often reflects the tone and subject matter. This can be seen in across a range of our work.     Breaking news coverage   When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about an event in one place.   Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.     ","Stopping the spread Reuters built an epidemic model to simulate how the coronavirus can spread within a population. We ran the model thousands of times to compare when ""herd immunity"" would kick in for various reproductive numbers and under a range of scenarios. The model enabled us to show readers what level of immunity would likely be required in order to stop the spread. Anatomy of Singapore's outbreak Reuters transformed printed Covid-19 case data into a slick animation of Singapore's explosive worker dormitory clusters. The piece documents and explains how and where clusters formed. We used WebGL to enable the reader's computer and browser to seamlessly render more than 30,000 nodes. How the novel Coronavirus has evolved The coronavirus has mutated into several major groups, or strains. Mapping and understanding those changes is crucial to developing strategies to combat COVID-19. Reuters unraveled and analyzed over 185,000 genome samples to show how the dominance of strains has shifted over time. Reuters Global COVID-19 Tracker Getting timely information about the spread of the coronavirus and putting the mountain of statistics in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. This tracker gives readers a key tool to filter down the firehose using custom algorithms to anticipate the headlines and mark milestones, progress and resurgence in a global and local context in five languages. Reuters independently collects infection and death data from each country, meaning our data is updated every few hours and often ahead of all other publications and dashboards. Australia's ecological disaster Australia's government called the bushfires crisis of 2020 ""an ecological disaster."" Reuters delivered the first data-driven analysis of fires and habitat data, showing how hundreds of species suffered. Air attack As some of the largest fires in California's history blazed in late summer, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection deployed a fleet of specially equipped firefighting aircraft. Reuters used a combination of flight data records, cartography, illustration to take an in-depth look at the types of aircraft and explain their specific roles. Patient 31 In February 2019, South Korea announced thousands of coronavirus cases in the space of only a few days, an outbreak that initially pushed their tally of cases higher than anywhere else outside of China. Reuters scraped daily press releases to build a data-driven account of the spread and emergence of patient 31, a single super spreader believed to be the source of thousands of infections. The piece went viral far outside Asia, with many on social media in the U.S. sharing it as an example of what can happen if social distancing isn't observed. Shielded Another example of strong public service journalism. This data investigation shows how an obscure legal doctrine called qualified immunity protects police accused of excessive force. This project was produced as police use of force was dominating U.S. headlines. Shifting smoke Reuters visualised and animated millions of atmospheric data points to show how smoke from U.S. wildfires travelled thousands of miles east, turning skies from New York to Washington D.C. hazy and reaching as far as Britain. How Joe Biden Democrat Joe Biden captured the U.S. presidency by expanding his party's appeal among suburban voters, in middle- and upper-income communities and in places where a large share of people graduated from college. On the Republican side, Trump made surprising gains among Latino populations in South Florida and in Texas along the border.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Süddeutsche Zeitung," Dear Sigma Awards Team,   we are submitting a portfolio on behalf of the Data Team at Süddeutsche Zeitung. The portfolio consists of major projects we did on the Coronavirus pandemic. As for every journalist, this has been a challenging year for us, but also an exciting one. We feel that we could really make a difference, as we tried to help our readership making sense of what’s going on. The virus is invisible to the naked eye, so looking at the numbers is the best way to figure out where we are and what might come next.   Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, we offer reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial stuff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals around the world.   The Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with strong ties to the investigations team. Members of our team worked on the Panama Papers, and we collected several prices for our work. In our understanding, data journalism is foremost journalism – our goal is to tell stories, to explain complex matters, to uncover injustice and corruption. Our means are data, code, web scraping, statistics, numerical language processing, network analysis.   We try to learn constantly. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and teaching each other are important pillars of our philosophy. Towards our readers, we try to be as transparent as we can be – publishing detailed descriptions of our methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible.   One challenge in 2020 was that our team lead, Vanessa Wormer, left the company in summer, and we had to re-organise. Currently, the team consists of Sabrina Ebitsch and Christian Endt (team lead), Martina Schories, Benedict Witzenberger, Sören Müller-Hansen and Berit Kruse. We report to Wolfgang Jaschensky, head of Editorial R&D, who is an important mentor, established the team and hired most of us. We work closely together with graphic designers, developers and science reporters, who also contributed to the submitted stories. "," Our coverage of the Coronavirus started with ""The Force of the Big Number"", an interactive in which we explained the danger of exponential growth and made clear how quickly a pandemic can get out of control. The story was published in mid-March, before any major restrictions there put in place in Germany. The story reached more than 2 million readers and is one of the most successful pieces in the history of Süddeutsche Zeitung.   Soon afterwards, we launched our Coronavirus Dashboard, which has been a part of our homepage <a href=""http://www.sueddeutsche.de"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>www.sueddeutsche.de   ever since, and has also been adapted to a big, daily graphic in the print edition. As first newsroom in Germany, we used the concept of doubling time to report the growth of case numbers in different areas and countries. This concept was soon adapted by other major outlets, our numbers were quoted in the main evening news program on national tv.   At several stages of the pandemic, we wrote long, in-depth pieces on Germany's situation in the pandemic: Where are we right now, where are we heading, what are the scenarios and options? All of these stories were data-driven, based on modelling and extensive interviews with many scientists. These stories rely heavily on animated, interactive visual elements.   ""The Long Road Through the Pandemic"" was published at the beginning of the first wave in Germany. The lockdown light was still new and the impression prevailed that it was only necessary to reduce the number of new infections for a short time in order to end the pandemic. Our research and calculations based on epidemiological models showed that this was a fallacy, that the pandemic could last for a very long time. The article met with great interest among our readership; never before has the Süddeutsche Zeitung been able to attract such a large number of subscribers via a single piece.   In one visual essay, we reflect on the difficulty to make decisions based on imperfect data with lots of limitations, and try to show a way of dealing with that situation of uncertainty.   Other pieces in our portfolio focus on fatality rates, excess mortality, and airborne spreading in indoor environments, and how to have a safe christmas in 2020.   Why we don't provide translations:   Our articles build heavily on visuals and interactive storytelling. Therefore we can`t just put the text into a PDF. What works best is using Google Translate via the add-on in your browser.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,"James Tozer, The Economist"," 2020 marked my second full year as a data journalist at The Economist, having started that role in mid-2018. Before then, from 2015-18 I had worked in The Economist's analytics department, where my job was to support the social team and news desk with information about our digital audiences. During that three-year period, I taught myself statistics and coding (mainly in Python), to supplement writing skills that I had developed by studying English at university. So when I was hired as a data journalist in 2018, I already had many of the tools I needed to perform the job. The Economist then paid for me to attend a course in machine learning at the London School of Economics, where I learned how to use R and GitHub. I have been very lucky to work closely with Kenn Cukier and Dan Rosenheck, who have been my bosses at various points during my career, and are extremely knowledgeable about the world of data journalism.       Most of my writing has been for Graphic Detail, a dedicated print section that the newspaper launched in late 2018. Contributing to GD is a great experience: Dan Rosenheck often gives me several weeks to work on ambitious pieces of quantitative research. And I get to collaborate with our fantastic team of designers, including Matt McLean, Ros Pearce and Martín González, to name just a few. This means that I am able to turn my story ideas into striking charts and graphics, including online interactives. To date, I have published more than 30 GD pieces, which is the most of any contributor. I also regularly edit GD when Dan Rosenheck is away, making me one of the youngest staff writers at The Economist to perform this role for a section of the newspaper. (I am currently 27 - I think that would have made me eligible for the Young Talent prize in previous years, though I'm no longer sure if this is the case! If I am eligible, I would like to enter.)       Above all, the thing that I enjoy about data journalism is the diversity of subjects that I get to cover. Among the areas that I reported on in 2020 are politics, economics, business, health, the environment, demography, history, the arts and sports. (I haven't included any of my sports articles in my portfolio, though I write about them often. In my spare time, I work as data analyst for the England men's rugby team, helping them to win two trophies in 2020: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/51745646 .) This means that I constantly get to speak to people who are doing interesting research in their fields, and to learn new things. I think that is the primary reason why I should be considered for this award: I have tried to bring statistical rigour to as wide a range of stories as possible, to tell them in new and interesting ways. "," My main project in 2020 has been The Economist's tracker of excess deaths from covid-19. I decided to create an international comparison of excess mortality in early April, when it became clear that the official death tolls in many countries were undercounting the actual number of people being killed. First I published an article about this problem using numbers from Italy, Spain and France. Then I built an interactive tracking page to display this data, along with my colleague Martín González, who designed the charts. Finally, I published all of the data, sources and code on GitHub. I used this database for several other stories throughout the year, including one in October that found signs of considerable immunity in the hardest-hit villages of Lombardy.       We were the first organisation to produce a resource like this, and it has been cited in more than 120 academic papers, according to Google Scholar (see link: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22economist.com%22+%22excess+deaths%22+%22covid%22). It has also encouraged several governments to release the necessary data on a regular basis. The Mexican health ministry cited our work in an official bulletin, and reproduced our heatmap design when it created its own report. Overall, the tracking page was the most viewed article on Economist.com in 2020, with more than 2m page views. (We have also submitted it for a Sigma project award.)       Another big project was using a dataset from Trase, a research group, to analyse illegal deforestation in the Amazon. My article explained how Trase matches satellite data on deforestation with export patterns for beef and soybeans. This allows us to estimate which agribusiness firms purchased most products from areas where illegal logging is rife. My colleague Sarah Esther Maslin wrote an accompanying article about the implications for the industry. Subsequently, several of the companies have promised full transparency on their supply chains.       At the start of 2020, for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I collaborated with Israel's Yad Vashem institute to illustrate the last known address of 736,000 of the camp's Jewish victims. Because of the sensitivity of the subject and the data, I interviewed several archivists at Yad Vashem to make sure that I was interpreting and presenting it appropriately. The final map displayed the extent of the devastation that the Nazis wrought on Europe's Jewish population.       I was the first journalist to publish an analysis of the 8th wave of the World Values Survey, which has been running since 1981 and is the best source of international data on public opinions. I used a machine-learning model to estimate how attitudes towards democracy have changed among particular demographic groups over the last 20 years. I found that there had been a clear swing towards support for autocrats, especially in weak democracies. The trend was strongest among people on the far right of the political spectrum.       For The Economist's Christmas edition, I wrote a 2,200-word essay about how data science is changing the liberal arts. I interviewed several of the leading researchers in the ""digital humanities"". And I combed through dozens of papers to identify those that displayed the most interesting crossovers between algorithms and the arts. My piece included charts from these papers, and an interactive chart that allowed readers to analyse nearly 3,000 19th-century British novels.       I also reported on several academic papers and resources. Included in my portfolio are a write-up of a fascinating study about gang violence and economic harm in El Salvador; and an article about the extent of ""bogus"" academic journals in certain fields.

United States,"Quartz, Substack, Vox, Scientific American",Big,Youyou Zhou," I would like the jury to consider my work in the past turbulent year for a personal portfolio award. The data and visual stories that I will detail below consists of two broad themes: the impact of the pandemic on communities of immigrants and migrants around the world in the first half of the year, and in the second half, the failed effort by the U.S. governments to contain the virus.    2020 was a special year career-wise for me. I accumulated a sizable body of work using data and visual storytelling skills in the subject domain of immigration and migration, which I cared deeply about and had reported out over the years. The stories I produced during the year created real world impact that reinforced my belief in the power of data journalism and visual storytelling.    I am a designer, a developer, and at the core, a journalist. I started working in data visualization and storytelling at a design studio in Washington, D.C. back in 2012. A few years later I switched to journalism, covering oftentimes top breaking news and big set events with data visualizations and interactive features at the Associated Press. But my obsession over data journalism—including mining messy data to identify trends and insights, writing scripts to produce beautiful curious data visualizations—is always about journalism: data and visuals need to be in service of storytelling that’s ultimately in services of the audience. With that in mind, I joined Quartz in 2017, which gave me an abundance of editorial freedom and support to pitch, report, write and produce stories on important global narratives. Instead of being a generalist, I strived to create space and produce data and visual stories around immigration and global migration.   My obsession over the topic is rooted in my personal experience as an immigrant. As reporting went, I found that the diverse immigrant communities and issues around them were significant but underreported. Immigrants are the driving forces of the global economy. Migration is and will continue to be a central topic affecting the changing demographics of the world, the internationalization of companies, the global competition for talents, our increasingly fluid identities in a digital and globalized world. These are topics well suited for data and visual presentations. I tracked down data trends and created visual narratives around topics including visas, immigration policies, citizenship, international students, and skilled labor. Some of that is reflected in my work in 2020.   2020 was also special in that it was the year I lost institutional support and challenged myself to go solo. The layoff in the middle of the year opened new opportunities for collaboration and experiments. The projects in the second half of the year, hopefully, reflect some of it. ","   1. How international students are supposed to deal with coronavirus, according to their US universities    <a href=""https://qz.com/1822530/"">https://qz.com/1822530/     When the U.S. announced the pandemic a national emergency, universities scrambled to close their campuses and dorms. They didn’t have plans for the large number of international students who did not have places to stay off-campus. To show the scope of the problem and the haphazard instructions universities gave to international students, I collected responses related to international students sheltering from the universities that hosted the most international students and displayed them in a full-page bleed of documents. The project shows the varying, often contradicting, responses students have been receiving on whether to leave or stay. The tones some colleges used showed that international students got lower priorities than domestic students, and some were dehumanizing.    The project includes the links for the audience to go to the colleges’ websites to track and check in case the messages were updated later. Some colleges contacted us after the project published about their updates.      2. (1) Those passports lost the most value during a pandemic <a href=""https://qz.com/1838486"">https://qz.com/1838486   & (2) These are the countries Americans can travel to right now without a visa  <a href=""https://qz.com/1893192/"">https://qz.com/1893192/     An American passport became quite useless in 2020. The countries that were most impacted by the pandemic saw the biggest drop in passport rankings. These two projects, one published in April and the other in September, tell the country-specific severity of the pandemic through the lens of passport rankings and how that has shifted from Asian countries in the spring to the U.S. in the fall.    The “snake graph” draws the audience in. The annotations contextualize and explain what’s happening on the screen for readers. I collected and verified the data, did the reporting, and built the charts.     3.  As the data became available, a reverse globalization could be seen around the world.   Foreigners <a href=""https://qz.com/1841999/"" target=""_blank"">have left the US  and <a href=""https://qz.com/1886412/"" target=""_blank"">other western developed countries .      4.  UK prepared to revamp its immigration system as Brexit deadline loomed. One of the proposals is a points-based immigration system to control who gets to work in UK. I built a calculator based on their released policies to answer:   Can you work in the UK under its new points-based immigration system?    <a href=""https://qz.com/1804992/"">https://qz.com/1804992/        5.  In other immigration stories:   (1) I charted the global inequality of mobility by showing that   <a href=""https://qz.com/1814238/"" target=""_blank"">citizens from richer countries had a higher chance of getting their US visas approved ;    (3) I looked into how the severe outbreaks in high-income countries affected low-income countries   <a href=""https://qz.com/1834566/"" target=""_blank"">due to a plunge in remittances .      6.  I was comissioned to visualize   <a href=""https://goldenstatswarrior.substack.com/p/the-working-story-of-chinese-immigration"" target=""_blank"">the history of Chinese immigrants in the Bay Area   on the newsletter  Golden Stats Warriors .      7.  I also worked on a number of data stories explaining Covid-19:   1) One examined   <a href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19"">the effect of mask mandates on containing the spread of the virus  . I did the data analysis and created the graphics. The story was retweeted by the governors of California and New York;   2) The individual decision of wearing a mask is often times a negotiation with the environment. We surveyed the US population on their behaviors of wearing masks in various social settings. I <a href=""https://www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors"">  produced a story that guided people through the decision making process  ;   3) In a story for  Scientific American , I analyzed the data and detailed  <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-is-now-the-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s1/""> how Covid-19 became the third leading cause of deaths in the US  .  ",https://qz.com/1822530/,https://qz.com/1838486,https://qz.com/1893192/,https://qz.com/1804992/ ,https://qz.com/1814238/,https://qz.com/1834566/,https://goldenstatswarrior.substack.com/p/the-working-story-of-chinese-immigration,www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19,www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-is-now-the-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s1/,,,,
United States,Quartz,Big,Quartz Things team portfolio," From its inception, Quartz has been on the forefront of many types of journalism: data, visual, interactive, sensor, and others. Led by our Things team, which is chiefly responsible for making these “things” that combine reporting with technical skills, our 2020 work continues to reflect that tradition. We’re proud to submit our team’s work for consideration of recognition from the Sigma Awards.   Our work consistently takes the form that is most appropriate for our readers and members to find understanding and insight. That is clear in “The coronavirus epidemic is changing emoji usage on Venmo,” where the data and visualization are the story and the text secondary. It’s also apparent in “Coronavirus antibody tests aren’t as accurate as they seem,” in which a customizable simulator takes center stage. But of course we sometimes let words drive the narrative, as you can see in our “Welcome to Leeside” project.   Our team’s vast array of skills is readily apparent in our work. Compare the abilities expressed with pieces like “emoji usage on Venmo,” “Mexico is illegally destroying protected mangrove trees to build an $8 billion oil refinery,” “antibody tests,” and “The Covid-19 pandemic has made canned foods, shelf-stable milk, and vodka seem better.” They run the gamut from collecting and analyzing massive datasets, to detecting changes in satellite images, to coding probabilistic simulations, to dynamically collecting and displaying reader responses.    We aren’t limited to quantitative methods: We use our numeracy and data skills to augment our qualitative reporting. That’s evident in “This is the year Hong Kong began speaking the Communist Party’s authoritarian language,” where a hunch from a reporter based in the city was borne out through a robust analysis of 165,000 public statements and transcripts we collected. It also showed in “This is the chance your local bank branch will close by July,” where our analysis of the dynamics driving changes in retail banking was localized to the readers in every US zip code.   Our work is beautifully designed and delights. It is built for users on desktop and mobile equally. It takes care to pay attention to accessibility, including making sure visual elements are described appropriately for people using screen readers, and has a dark mode for people who need a low-brightness or different-contrast experience.   Finally, and perhaps most importantly: We don’t take our readers’ knowledge of data or statistics for granted. We regularly produce work that helps them gain a greater appreciation for not just our work but the entire media industry. To help with our members’ understanding of the torrent of pandemic-related data, we published “The data deluge,” a resource of data fundamentals. And when the US government’s initial Paycheck Protection Program loan data was released, we didn’t rush into it to provide commodity coverage about the recipients of the largest loans or the areas with the most financing. We provided context to our readers with “Here’s what we know is wrong with the PPP data.” Without these kinds of resources, many readers would be ill equipped to understand some of the most important stories of the year.   It’s no surprise that on average, work made by or assisted by Things team members in 2020 had more readers than Quartz articles that did not. It’s also no surprise that the team’s work was some of the most successful at converting our readers into paying members who, no doubt, think of our work not as data journalism or visual journalism but simply as journalism—which is just as it should be. ","   Coronavirus antibody tests aren’t as accurate as they seem    By simulating the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests on a hypothetical population, we left our readers with a greater understanding of how even tests with accuracy figures near 100% can lead to false results.          Welcome to Leeside    While it looks like a traditional high-production news article, it’s designed—from its content to its layout to its interactivity—as a museum exhibit about a not-so-distant future that the world is headed towards. The lens allowed us to merge real-world data and dynamics with simulations and imagined artifacts to create an immersive story of a community dealing with the realities of climate change.         Mexico is illegally destroying protected mangrove trees to build an $8 billion oil refinery    In a classic example of using contemporary techniques to augment traditional reporting, we used satellite imagery to not only show the destruction of mangrove trees visually, but also quantitatively by using software to measure the amount of destroyed vegetation that can be seen in the images.          The Covid-19 pandemic has made canned foods, shelf-stable milk, and vodka seem better    We began collecting responses from our readers on two simple questions: Is a grocery item generally good, bad, or neither, and now that the pandemic has set in is it good, bad, or neither. We charted the results live and were able to show which items had become more and less desirable.         This is the year Hong Kong began speaking the Communist Party’s authoritarian language    We analyzed the language used in 165,000 public statements to show the steep rise in authoritarian language that was showing up in government statements as Beijing started more forcefully inserting itself into Hong Kong’s governance.         This is the chance your local bank branch will close by July    We analyzed the data on just under 100,000 US bank branches from the FDIC and crafted a multivariate model to determine the probability that a branch location closes in a given year. As we explain in our findings and methodology we automatically insert the data about your area and a nearby bank. Alternatively you can manually select almost any bank branch in the US.         The data deluge    This is a field guide to help our members to understand and navigate data and data analysis during the pandemic and beyond. Of particular note are the pieces “The challenge of percent change,” “How to compare data that change over time,” and “Covid-19 is a reminder to beware of seasonality in data”         The main metric economists use to measure inequality is deeply flawed    This was another service to our readers to help them understand a commonly reported metric. Through clear diagrams, the promise and limitations of the Gini coefficient are made apparent with simple, plain language.         Here’s what we know is wrong with the PPP data    Our soup-to-nuts analysis of the original PPP data release’s flaws involved not just the data itself, but comparisons to databases from the US Postal Service, Social Security Administration, and Census Bureau. That allowed us to discover data about applicants that the government had intended to keep private.         The coronavirus epidemic is changing emoji usage on Venmo    We collected data from Venmo, analyzed it, and created a story that treats the data and visualization as primary content.

Brazil,Agência Pública (apublica.org),Small,Bruno Fonseca,"   Bruno Fonseca is an editor and reporter at Agência Pública, the first non-profit investigative news agency in Brazil. A multimedia reporter, he works with infographics, data, videos and animation. His work has received several awards, such as the Petrobras Journalism Award, the Vladimir Herzog Award for Human Rights, the Brazilian Bar Association Journalism Award for Human Rights and the first and second place of the <a href=""https://alleyesontheamazon.org/aea-announces-winners-of-the-data-journalism-contest-all-eyes-on-the-amazon/"">Data Journalism Contest “All Eyes on the Amazon”  in 2020. Fonseca has bachelor and master degrees from the Federal University of Minas Gerais and attended the Thomson Reuters Journalism Course on Multimedia Reporting.      He's been working as a journalist for 10 years, developing data visualization and infographics since the beginning of his career. Throughout his trajectory he has dedicated himself to producing illustration and animation works to create multimedia contents that allow the visualization of large data analysis. He has been working at Agência Pública for seven years conducting investigations on topics such as environment, health, public policies and gender and race-based inequalities using open databases. His professional inspirations range from design professionals like Alberto Cairo, Giorgia Lupi and Mariana Santos, to journalists working with public databases like Amanda Rossi, Carolina Moreno, Cecília Olliveira, Gustavo Faleiro, Sérgio Spagnuolo and Stefano Wrobleski.  ","   In 2020, Bruno Fonseca was part of Agência Pública's coverage of the consequences of the pandemic on the lives of the most vulnerable Brazilians. He also dedicated himself to investigating the Bolsonaro administration policies for the environment in 2020, when the Amazon rainforest deforestation surged to 12-year high under Bolsonaro and fires ravaged the Pantanal region; and he helped cover the Brazilian municipal elections in november. For this application we have selected three data-oriented pieces that represent the work Bruno Fonseca developed at Agência Pública in 2020. He has acted as data editor, reporter and art/infographic editor in all of them.      The first article, entitled ""In Brazil, COVID-19 death rate for black community is higher than for other populations"" and published in may, showed how the pandemic has been affecting the black and white populations differently in Brazil. It revealed that, at that time, one in three black patients had died from complications due to the virus compared to one in 4.4 deaths among white Brazilian patients. The piece also showed the discrepancies in deaths and hospitalizations between rich and mainly white neighbourhoods and poor and predominantly black ones. This article was republished by 54 other media outlets and was translated to <a href=""https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/29/in-brazil-covid-19-death-rate-for-black-community-is-higher-than-for-other-populations/"">english , <a href=""https://es.globalvoices.org/2020/06/04/en-dos-semanas-el-numero-de-negros-que-han-muerto-por-coronavirus-es-cinco-veces-mayor-en-brasil/"">spanish , <a href=""https://fr.globalvoices.org/2020/07/09/253451/"">french , <a href=""https://it.globalvoices.org/2020/07/in-brasile-il-tasso-di-mortalita-da-covid-19-per-la-comunita-nera-e-superiore-a-quello-delle-altre-popolazioni/"">italian , <a href=""https://ar.globalvoices.org/2020/07/14/66463/"">arabic , <a href=""https://ru.globalvoices.org/2020/07/14/95353/"">russian  and <a href=""https://el.globalvoices.org/2020/07/56089"">greek .

(US). So far, the piece has been mentioned and/or backlinked in more than 100 publications, including articles by the brazilian newspaper <a href=""https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/gestao-politica-e-sociedade/cpfs-negros-importam-racismo-estrutural-e-politicas-publicas-no-contexto-da-covid-19/"">Estadão , one of the most prominent in the country, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/enormous-disparities-coronavirus-death-rates-expose-brazils-deep-racial-inequalities"">The Guardian .      The second article, ""Bolsonaro government reduces fines in municipalities where deforestation is growing"", was published in August. It revealed that for every ten municipalities in the Amazon region where there were less fines for environmental crimes in 2019, eight reported an increase in deforestation. Moreover, it showed that the Bolsonaro administration had even reduced the number of fines in 2020, in relation to the previous year. The article was republished by 22 national websites and mentioned in articles by international outlets, such as <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxj7q/brazil-is-persecuting-its-own-environmental-protection-workers-whistleblowers-say"">Vice News  (US) and <a href=""https://www.dn.pt/mundo/delirio-negacionismo-bolsonaro-mentiu-10-vezes-na-onu--12753066.html"">Diário de Notícias  (Portugal). This story was also featured in the important french publication <a href=""https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/chiffre-du-jour-amazonie-moins-damendes-pour-crimes-contre-lenvironnement-plus-de"">Courrier International .      The article third article, ""In the Amazon, 118 politicians with environmental fines run for election"", revealed that 118 of the candidates for mayor and deputy mayor in the November local elections had previously been fined for deforestation, illegal burning, exploitation of native forest located in reserves, or providing false information to environmental agencies to cover up illegal activities - and that 28 of them were running for reelection. The piece was republished 19 times, including an english version featured in the conservation and environmental science news platform <a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2021/01/brazil-elections-boost-environmental-violators-to-high-office-in-amazon/"">Mongabay.       All three pieces were produced using open data, accessible to any citizens and journalists. These works shine light on important social issues, necessary to better understand the current political, environmental and health scenario in Brazil. By doing so, they had repercussions on the national press and served as tools to help civil society organisations orient their actions.      The biggest challenge was finding new and investigative ways to process open databases that could aid the comprehension of the various social and political contexts in today's Brazil. Moreover, working with these open databases without any assistance or answers from the government agencies that produced them was a tough challenge. Different formats and missing information in several databases made the work more complex and added additional layers of research and investigations to be done using other means and sources to fill in the gaps.

Bolivia,Revista Muy Waso,Small,Panel y base de datos COVID-19 en Bolivia," Bolivia is the country with the worst public information system concerning the pandemic in Latin America. The right to information on a collective issue has been suppressed and access to reliable and transparent data is restricted. To fight this violation of an essential human right in this crisis, during 2020 we were the only magazine with the most complete data and graphic repository in Bolivia and we produce notes and research (about it) that the traditional media ignore.     We are one of the fastest growing and best rated native digital media in Bolivia. We are a team of younger, independent and self-managed journalists. We launched as an entertainment, arts and culture magazine in July 2018.Since 2019 we expanded our coverage areas, covering health, society and politics. We currently specialize in narrative journalism, data journalism and investigative journalism. En 2020 nuestro trabajo periodístico fue beneficiario de fondos del Facebook Journalism Project, Google News Initiative e Internews.    In addition to our work as a media outlet, we carry out social projects in different areas. Our most successful project took place in a women's prison in the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia, which included the publication of our first book authored by 15 women convicts. Recently, within the framework of the health emergency, we delivered more than a ton of food and cleaning supplies, which we collected through the monetary contribution of our users in social networks, for the same penitentiary. "," In 2020, during the health emergency caused by COVID-19, the Bolivian government did not provide transparent epidemiological information and did not give the public access to databases on the number of sick people, their sex, their ages or the number of tests, among other relevant information.    This lack of information forced us to manually compile the information we obtained through photographs, PDF documents, epidemiological reports in images (JPG) or video reports. Thanks to this work we were able to put together the most complete database and graphs of the entire Bolivian media ecosystem. Our panel of graphs and data provided detailed and disaggregated information about location, age, sex, hospital capacity, number of deaths and tests.    With this data we followed up, for six months, the information on COVID-19 in Bolivia and verified the official news and discourses that provided incorrect or distorted information.    Due to the economic crisis that affected our newsroom, we could not continue with this work after September 2020, but our work served as inspiration for civil society organizations, data experts and civilians to get involved in the control and monitoring of the epidemiological information provided by the Bolivian authorities.    With that perspective, thanks to our strategic alliances, we opened space for an open data event about the State's purchases during the health emergency called DatActivate.    We are currently working on an episode for our podcast that shows the efforts of citizens and independent journalists to make the epidemiological information on COVID-19 in Bolivia transparent.  ",https://muywaso.com/especial-de-datos-muy-waso-sobre-el-coronavirus-en-bolivia/,https://muywaso.com/datactivate/,https://muywaso.com/bolivia-tiene-el-peor-sistema-de-informacion-covid-19-de-sudamerica/,https://muywaso.com/14-mil-muertes-que-no-se-pueden-ocultar-y-una-tasa-de-subregistro-del-75/,https://muywaso.com/la-salud-de-los-migrantes-venezolanos-en-bolivia-entre-la-solidaridad-y-la-desinformacion/,https://muywaso.com/covid-19-casi-medio-millon-de-abuelitxs-vive-en-zonas-de-alto-riesgo/,https://muywaso.com/bolivia-la-lucha-contra-el-vih-pierde-terreno-frente-a-la-covid-19/,https://muywaso.com/alcaldias-gastan-mas-en-comida-para-policias-y-militares-que-en-civiles/,https://muywaso.com/beni-solo-hizo-48-pruebas-hasta-el-dia-del-estallido-epidemiologico/,https://muywaso.com/son-los-agachaditos-una-alternativa-para-prevenir-el-contagio-de-la-covid-19/,,,,
United States,"The Texas Tribune, ProPublica",Big,Texas Tribune Data Visuals Team Portfolio," Data journalism is a foundational practice and value at the Texas Tribune. A decade into our existence, data reporting was more important than ever. The coronavirus pandemic made access to accurate information a matter of public safety, and the Tribune’s data visuals team was uniquely prepared to cover the pandemic’s impacts. Our team’s 2020 portfolio shows how we leveraged our expertise in data reporting, analysis, design and presentation to make crucial information clear to Texans in acts of public service and accountability journalism.      The Tribune’s data visuals team in 2020 consisted of an editor, Darla Cameron; three developers, Chris Essig, Carla Astudillo and Mandi Cai; an investigative data reporter, Ren Larson; and fellow Anna Novak. Our work is supported by designer Emily Albracht and the Tribune’s editors, audience team and engineers. We work seamlessly together, and we strive to maintain an environment where the collaboration required to publish our most complex and demanding journalism is possible.    The best example of this collaboration is our coronavirus case tracker, which we take turns updating every day. The tracker is an example of what we do so well — gather complex data, distill it, and present it to readers in a way that they can understand. It’s also a daily accountability story, and the Tribune’s most viewed story of 2020. As Texas rolled back its restrictions and case totals surged multiple times, the tracker was a clear and consistent place for readers to understand how state leaders’ decisions impacted their personal safety.    Coronavirus data was just part of our work in 2020. In the spring, after years of planning and development, we reimagined a core Tribune product — our government salaries database — in a way that is both easier for readers to use and a better tool for accountability reporting. The Tribune launched a new investigative team with ProPublica, which uncovered the story of a company that was suing thousands of low-income Latino immigrants during the pandemic and stopped after we started asking questions. We investigated why Texas’ largest cities spend more on police than anything else in their budgets. The data visuals team built tools to help Texans learn how to cast their ballots safely in a state that opted not to expand voting by mail. We also published the most comprehensive election results in the state.    Our portfolio for the year reflects our organization’s dedication to presenting a full picture for readers, giving them the tools to be more thoughtful, productive and engaged citizens.

Argentina,Data Journalism course (Social Sciences Department - National University of Avellaneda) -UNDAV-,Small,Datos UNDAV,"   Datos UNDAV  is the Data Journalism chair of the National University of Avellaneda -UNDAV- (Argentina), which functions as a space for teaching, learning, laboratory for experimentation and practice of data journalism for students.     Students' data journalism articles are at <a href=""http://datosundav.com.ar/"">datosundav.com.ar  (Link to automatic translation into English of the full site: <a href=""http://bit.ly/3rdWZNw"">http://bit.ly/3rdWZNw )    Since 2015, the UNDAV's Bachelor of Journalism includes within its study plan the subject Data Journalism. In this way, UNDAV became a pioneer in Latin America in the teaching of data journalism in an undergraduate degree and with a specific subject.   The main goal of Datos UNDAV is to provide conceptual frameworks and practical tools that allow thinking about and exercising data journalism.   Throughout the semester, students get the necessary skills for the production of journalistic pieces created from large databases and the creation of  interactive visualizations using digital tools available on the web. They will have the skills required to join the data journalism team of any professional newsroom.   The subject includes theoretical content and the use of digital tools for searching, processing and curating data, as well as for publishing and visualizing information. In addition, cases of good practices in data journalism in national media, the region and the rest of the world are studied. Also, it proposes that students know the process of requesting access to public information both national and local level.     I am Damián Profeta (@damianprofeta)  and the subject is in my charge. I have been practicing journalism for 15 years and I have been teaching at the university level for 10 years. In 2015 I was summoned to create the subject Data Journalism. Since then, 12 cohorts of students had the oportunity of learning the basics of data journalism and putting it into practice in a classroom-workshop-newsroom modality.   The Datos UNDAV experience was presented in the 8th. International Forum of Digital Journalism at the National University of Rosario (UNR) at the end of 2015: <a href=""http://bit.ly/3rk867B"">http://bit.ly/3rk867B    Likewise, the experience was reviewed in an article in the first digital book of the Meeting of Chairs of Investigative Journalism in Argentina ""In search of journalism that inquires into power."" 2016: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2NW2bqY"">http://bit.ly/2NW2bqY    Furthermore, the Datos UNDAV proposal was selected in the first order of merit as a research project to analyze and describe the practice of data journalism in Latin America. The work was a combination of research and journalistic practice with the students and was funded by the National University of Avellaneda - Call ""PIPP 2018"" carried out among 2019 y 2020: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2NZj04h"">http://bit.ly/2NZj04h    In 2019, the experience of the UNDAV in teaching data journalism as a unique case in public universities in Argentina with a specific subject in a university journalism career was highlighted in the investigation of the National University of Lomas de Zamora ( UNLZ) ""Public Universities that teach data journalism in Argentina: which ones, how and why"". Abstract in english: <a href=""https://bit.ly/3axr6sz"">https://bit.ly/3axr6sz    In 2019, also, I defended my master's thesis on teaching data journalism. It was evaluated as Outstanding by the San Andrés University (UdeSA). ","   DatosUNDAV.com.ar  includes   <a href=""http://bit.ly/2MUODLL"">24 articles on data journalism created in 2020  from public databases in Argentina  on issues of gender, The use of public funds, human trafficking, employment, economy, health, education, housing, aboriginal peoples and others. They have their corresponding data analysis with a journalistic perspective, relevant sources consulted, stories with human value and data visualizations.   The articles based in databases created by Datos UNDAV 2020 students have journalistically relevant findings for Argentina, such as:    -Almost 3 out of every ten patients who need a transplant die before they can be included on a waiting list.     -In 2020, public financial aid for children of femicide victims was doubled.     -For the first time in history, more women than men preside over the committees of the National Senate.     -Only one out of every one hundred requests to carry arms is made by a woman.     -Most people with disabilities do not process their disability certificate due to ignorance of how to do the process and its advantages.    It also includes about <a href=""https://4eqsfccwf42hzajhhiescsl3ue--datosundav-com-ar.translate.goog/entrevistas/"">  30 in-depth interviews with data journalists from Latin America  . The interviews were conducted by students of the subject and are part of a research funded by the university to analyze and characterize data journalism in the region. Journalists from La Nación Data y Chequeado, from Argentina; as well as, from Ojo Público, from Peru; El Tiempo and Cuestión Pública, from Colombia, Sudestada, from Uruguay; Post Data Club, from Cuba; Serendipia, from Mexico, among many other data journalists from media across the region share their experiences, work, visions and perspectives on this practice, in invaluable material for students and anyone interested in data journalism in Latin America.   The Data Journalism subject  (Datos UNDAV) became over time one of the most valued by students. The result of this positive assessment is the growth in enrollment semester by semester and a   video  in which some students shared their appreciation of the subject to promote it in the rest of the students of the career:   <a href=""https://youtu.be/5uPm_1l1F4w"">https://youtu.be/5uPm_1l1F4w   (only in Spanish).   Despite having a national law on access to public information and some laws at the provincial level, in 2020, due to the pandemic, the legal deadlines for the delivery of information to citizens (and students, in this case) were suspended and that was an added difficulty.   Likewise, despite the existence of legal frameworks, a gap persists between the laws and their practice: the information is usually provided incomplete, with arbitrary omissions and in closed formats that make it difficult to handle, analyze and process.   Although they are difficulties, all the more in the case of students, they also represent challenges that they undertake with enthusiasm.        Note: each work has the signature of its respective authors, students of Digital Journalism from the National University of Avellaneda. I am the professor and researcher in charge of the subject and coordinating the work of the students and the correction, editing and qualification of the articles.

United States,ProPublica,Big,ProPublica," With a team of more than 100 dedicated journalists, ProPublica covers a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, health care, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to<a href=""https://www.propublica.org/impact"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> spur real-world impact  . Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels.   One thing core to the work we do is the belief that data journalism is a key way in which we can hold power to account and shine a light into dark places. In 2020, we published a range of stories and interactive pieces that do just that. "," The projects we’re presenting were some of our most ambitious: we uncovered the activities of a secret Chinese propaganda network, exposed landlords who were illegally attempting to evict tenants during the pandemic, published long-secret NYPD disciplinary files, showed how climate change will devastate parts of the country and much more.    These stories, graphics and databases run the gamut from pieces that hold governments accountable to those that probe systemic harms brought by private companies and even the Catholic church.    Among them are some of our most popular projects, racking up millions of readers and some impact: companies stopped filing evictions, New York City is considering new NYPD reforms and senators wrote to debt collectors like Capital One asking them to stop seizing workers’ paychecks.

United States,McClatchy Washington Bureau,Small,Shirsho Dasgupta,"   I think my first proper encounter with data journalism was with the publication of the Panama Papers in 2016. Back then I had just started a Master’s degree in English and was still undecided between wanting to become a reporter or an academic. Eventually I settled on the former and while I wanted to work on investigations in general, it was in journalism school that I properly discovered my love for data reporting (I like to think I was always good at Math, so that wasn’t a mental block that I had to overcome), especially while working as a student-reporter for Crosstown LA, a hyperlocal data-driven news outlet based in the campus.       After graduating, I joined the McClatchy Washington Bureau where I work almost exclusively with one of McClatchy’s papers, the Miami Herald. I have worked on projects based on data sets as varied as cancer treatment billings, police shootings, hospital ownership and leaked information involving thousands of documents or emails. My work last year has involved covering the COVID crisis in Florida, especially its toll on the state’s prison system and nursing homes; the impact the Black Lives Matter protests had on policing protocols; uncovering the influence private prison giants Geo Group has on both Washington, DC and Tallahassee; a $4 billion cryptocurrency scheme spanning the Americas and Europe; and the alleged role of U.S. administration officials in an attempted coup in Venezuela.        As someone who’s been in the field of data journalism for roughly two years, I am of course indebted to my professors and mentors at the journalism school of the University of Southern California. I’m also very grateful that my editors and colleagues trusted a 26-year-old newcomer to the field with important investigations.    I personally view data as not just numbers but more broadly as “information” ⁠— a dump of emails has the same value for me as a spreadsheet with loads of numbers. I think in this sense, it is important for data reporters to also learn and become adept at using research tools like LexisAdvance, PACER, the various OSINT tools available online. I also think ⁠— and this is something I try to do with the stories I work on as well ⁠— that it is very important to have a good narrative and human voices to support the data analysis. Corruption, violence or governmental failures is not just a matter of numbers ⁠— they leave behind victims and at the end of the day it is their story that we as journalists are trying to tell.       I also try to inform myself and unlearn prior assumptions and misconceptions about societal issues as much as possible. The information that a data reporter works with is not generated in vacuums and it is very important to be aware of how factors like gender, race, caste, class, sexuality or even nationality work and influence our daily lives and the events around us.       In my opinion, newsrooms in general should do as much as they can to promote some amount of data literacy among non-data journalists as well. The COVID-19 pandemic, if anything, has shown how important it is for reporters from all beats to have some basic understanding of data. My advice for journalism students interested in data reporting would be to take at least one class in accounting, statistics or financial reporting.       Thank you for considering my portfolio for the Young Talent award.   ","   My portfolio is built upon the work I produced at the Washington bureau of McClatchy newspapers in 2020. As a data reporter in an investigative unit that closely works with the Miami Herald (one of McClatchy’s papers), I produce data-driven stories both by myself and in collaboration with others.      Like most journalists last year, I was tasked with covering the COVID pandemic in Florida. Data analysis-based stories that I reported and produced included articles on the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241576496.html"">plight of the uninsured in the midst of a health crisis , the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241691226.html"">fears and anxieties of the loved ones of those in the state’s prison system , the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article242338421.html"">enormous political influence wielded by a private prison contractor with the worst COVID-safety record  and how <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article247430840.html"">COVID infections surged after Florida’s governor eased visitation restrictions . Besides interviewing sources and writing the narratives for these stories, I analyzed and created visualizations from data as varied as the number of people insured per county, prison inmate populations, demographics and budgets, federal and state lobbying records and campaign contributions, and nursing home infection rates.       A few weeks after protests erupted across the United States after police officers killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, I created a survey, collected responses and produced a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article243980492.html"">how the protests had managed to change police use-of-force policies in many of the country’s biggest cities . I also worked with a colleague to report a story on the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article243760662.html"">hundreds of surplus military-grade weapons and tactical gear that are handed out to local police departments by the U.S. Defense Department  and how the number of transferred weapons correlates to the number of people killed by officers of those departments.       Besides reporting investigative stories on a breaking news cycle, I also worked on enterprise projects. I sifted through a massive cache of emails, financial records and other documents found in a leak of data from a bank in the Cayman Islands and uncovered <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article244763002.html"">how a Russian oligarch concealed from the IRS hundreds of millions in taxes . As one of the lead reporters in the Miami Herald/McClatchy collaboration with ICIJ and BuzzFeed News for the FinCEN Files, I scoured through the Suspicious Activity Reports and produced a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article245623470.html"">a $4 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme spanning Florida, the British Virgin Islands and Europe . Later in 2020, I also went through 40 GB worth of text messages, photos, videos and documents and together with my colleagues reported a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article246819562.html"">the involvement of Trump administration officials in a failed coup attempt in Venezuela to depose Nicolás Maduro .       Combining data analysis, public records and testimonies from individuals, my stories on the Florida prison system and offshore shell companies shone some light into the workings of institutions that generally operate under a shroud of secrecy and opacity. The stories I reported on the workings of law enforcement brought fresh attention to the issue of transferring military-grade weapons to local police departments and also quantified something that is generally spoken of in abstract terms — the impact of protests on policy. Besides being published in the papers owned by the McClatchy chain, many of the stories were also later republished in other outlets and referred to in newsletters.       I believe my portfolio and the varied subjects I’ve covered in my reporting speaks to my skills as someone who is just about two years into their career.   ",https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241576496.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241691226.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article242338421.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article247430840.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article243760662.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article243980492.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article244763002.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article245623470.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article246819562.html,,,,,
United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,John Burn-Murdoch," I suspect I speak for many data and visualisation journalists when I say that for most of my career, regardless of any praise it has garnered, my work has felt relatively trivial. Charts of tennis players, polls and election results are all very well, but they rarely feel essential to anybody. Perhaps a colourful graphic sparks joy in someone, or a polling chart makes someone happy thet ""their team"" is winning, but I’ve rarely felt that any of my work has really changed anyone’s life. 2020 has been ... a little different.   The last twelve months have been by far the busiest of my life, frequently clocking off after midnight and almost always juggling half a dozen stories simultaneously, but they’ve also been the most worthwhile months of my life by some distance, and I’ve never felt more like I’m making an actual difference to people’s lives. I never thought a chart could save a life, but anecdotally at least, this year it <a href=""https://twitter.com/triweasel/status/1347531140035440641"">may have happened .   I’ve been in data journalism to some or other degree for almost 10 years now, but I suspect I will look back on my career in two halves, separated by the onset of the pandemic. Up until twelve months ago I would sniff around the corridoors of the FT to see if I could find a way to get a story of my own published. We data journalists weren’t often considered to be ""words journalists"". ""Could you do some charts for this piece?"" was often how the day went, and the days rolled into weeks.   But now it’s different. I’ve written more words and more stories over the last twelve months than I had done in several years previously. Not only are my story pitches routinely greenlit, editors come to me for advice on whether other stories should run at all, and if so how they should be done. For a period last spring, civil servants from multiple countries would cold-call me to ask for advice on how they should present data to their publics. Over the last year, my stories, videos and tweets have been seen by several hundred million people in countries all over the world, and they’ve helped people navigate an incredibly difficult, turbulent time.   Essentially, after 10 years [for me, and decades for data journalism as a discipline] it feels like the world has finally *got* data journalism. It’s sad that it took a lethal global pandemic, and it’s sad that even now it’s often the wider public who appreciate the value before an old-school news editor does, but all I can say is it’s been an immense honour to have had the opportunity to reach so many people across the world, to <a href=""https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%22logarithmic%20scale%22"">introduce millions to log scales , and to improve public understanding of a global health crisis at a time when they were so poorly served by political leaders and other parts of the media.   After a year of at times literally round-the-clock efforts to bring the best and most important information to people as quickly as possible, a year where I feel I have graduated from ""charts and numbers guy"" to bona fide journalist, it would mean an enormous amount to me to be considered for the portfolio prize at this year’s Sigma awards. ","Pre-pandemic work: I used R to carry out an original, high-level economic analysis of detailed data on the UK labour force, showing which parts of the UK would be most affected by a proposed tightening of the country's restrictions on immigration from the EU in the aftermath of Brexit. The raw Labour Force Survey data is the source material that the UK's government statisticians use to calculate economic statistics, but it is rarely analysed outside of this context other than by private sector economic analysts, think-tanks and academic researchers. To the best of my knowledge, no journalist has ever done their own analysis of this data before. The result was a custom dataset exclusive to the FT, and a strong and important story on how strict immigration rules will impact migrants and locals alike in different areas of the UK. Story link Main pandemic work: In early March I built and published the first version of what went on to become our iconic Coronavirus Trajectory Tracker chart. For the next 45 successive nights, I updated this chart, going on to add more than nine additional charts as well, covering data in subnational regions and incorporating an ever-growing number of countries. The data sourcing work here was extremely complex, since we did not trust some of the uncredentialled aggregator sites such as Worldometer, and Johns Hopkins University (who were using data from Worldometer). This meant I had to resort to techniques including scraping government press releases and extracting figures from within paragraphs, scraping near-unscrapable dashboards built in Tableau and PowerBI, crowd-sourcing translations of Korean-language PDFs, and setting up an entire new email inbox to receive tips from readers on data sources. Between the data sourcing and the charts, this unbroken series of daily work, seven-days a week, is probably my career highlight in terms of the public service that I delivered. Story where charts appeared at the time As important as the data sourcing and the charts, in my view, were the explainers that I did throughout the pandemic to ensure people were not confused or misled. These included: an explainer on log scales, which we then spun out into a full explainer video covering multiple bases. That video was followed by others introducing and explaining other useful ways of representing and following the evolution of the pandemic, and latterly a myth-busting explainer of why Covid-19 is not simply a bad flu, and the virus's winter surge is far more lethal than past winter flu seasons I spent several weeks compiling data on deaths from all causes in dozens of countries around the world, allowing us to estimate the number of ""excess deaths"" during the pandemic around the world. This involved holding authoritarian regimes to account, and allowed us to show the true death tolls at at time when many countries were struggling to keep track. The data collection task here was the most ambitous of my career, involving the automation of convoluted processes for different countries with different data formats and often in different languages. I wrote scrapers in R and node.js, cleaned, transfored and analysed the data in R, and plotted the charts in d3.

Big Local News works with newsrooms to process, analyze and archive the data they collect, including building tools to help journalists retrieve the information they need to tell important stories.      This platform allows journalists – whether freelancers, reporters from one company or collaborations across multiple news organizations – to share data and work together as they report out stories. The platform is being integrated with specialized tools for data cleaning and analysis. Big Local News also has a relationship with the Stanford Digital Repository where both raw and processed data can be archived permanently. Archived data is then be made publicly available.      This work is designed to be journalist-driven and transformative, to help find solutions for local newsrooms’ ability to produce accountability journalism — the type of journalism that can shift policy and law and create impact.  ","   The first week of March 2020, Big Local News launched its platform at NICAR, the annual conference for data journalists. At the conference in New Orleans, we held two sessions where we demoed the platform and answered questions, and then also led a hands-on workshop for developers to familiarize them with using the API to pipe data in and out of various projects.       This happened just as the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in shutdowns across the country and the globe. The platform launched in beta, but quickly transformed to a vital hub of information and guidance related to understanding data that could be used to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on local communities. Within the space of three weeks, the three Big Local News staff members, engaged Stanford students and partner newsrooms collected, processed and released a dozen data-sets. Among them: data on community vulnerability; hospital beds data from Medicare Reports, leavened with contextual detail from the Census; data on nursing homes; daily updates of the four main repositories of COVID-case data; and tweets from governors, health departments and more. Platform users have added more data to share with others as well, from data on efforts to provide free meals to reports from medical examiners and COVID case models. The Big Local News team has added even more contextual data on hospitals and data on layoff notices, updated weekly. And students working with Big Local News has been a part of analyzing data and reporting stories on these topics.      That week of the conference, there were around 70 users of the platform. A week later, there were nearly 200. By mid-May, there were 827 users, and also more than 800 files being hosted on the platform in more than 60 projects. We twice have seen usage jump by more than 70 new users in a single day. Today, there are more than 1,500 users, 177 projects and more than 2,900 data files. The platform features 33 Open Projects -- those open to anyone using the platform, with data ranging from evictions to nursing home inspections, PPP loans and layoffs.       Our goal throughout has been to support local journalists. Toward that end, and with Google News Initiative support, we created the <a href=""http://covid19.biglocalnews.org/county-maps/index.html#/"">COVID19 Case Mapper  along with a design studio, Pitch Interactive. It went live on April 14. By creating embeddable interactive maps at the national, state and county levels, using <a href=""https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data"">New York Times data  for the U.S. map and Johns Hopkins data for the global map, Big Local News made embedding maps for local journalists simple and quick. As of Jan. 4, 2021, our Case Mapper had 10,687 embeds and generated more than 2 million page views. Here are just a few examples of how the embed was used by local news outlets: <a href=""https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/iowa-department-public-health-coronavirus-map-counties-covid-19"">The Gazette in Cedar Rapids, Iowa ; <a href=""https://abc11.com/nc-coronavirus-map-update-covid-19/6087356/"">ABC 11 in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina ; <a href=""https://thepublicsradio.org/news/updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak"">The Public’s Radio in Rhode Island ; and <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2020/04/18/at-least-20-pima-county-coronavirus-deaths-single-tucson-nursing-home/5141208002/"">AZCentral in the Phoenix metropolitan area.       We have embarked on other projects too, providing nearly $200,000 in grants to journalists around the world to pursue data-driven COVID stories and then share the data and recipes for how to replicate similar stories elsewhere.      Now, we are working toward automating courts data we have scraped on evictions in collaboration with the University of Maryland, and developing new tools within the platform to make it easier to find the important stories within the data.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,The Guardian's Coronavirus portfolio," This year, I’ve been focusing on making the nuances of the coronavirus pandemic more understandable for Guardian readers. Since joining the Guardian, this has meant digging through the noise to find data-driven stories that reveal new points about the pandemic.    Aside from our live-tracking pages, I have also uncovered stories on how 2020 summer relaxations were leading 10 countries to face rising cases, how densely-packed and deprived BAME communities were hardest-hit, how modelling showed that the 'real' English infection rate could be as high as 20%, and how the winter wave has driven record demand on the NHS.   Collectively these data-driven news stories have received hundreds of thousands of views. While our trackers continually serve to cover the bases of the pandemic’s progression, these pieces of data journalism aim to take the story further: they aim to reveal how coronavirus is impacting specific communities, or how government policy has led to coronavirus spreading in a certain way. These require a more bespoke analysis on a specific issue compared to the trackers, but are just as important to cover.   Such pieces use data to unveil problems or injustices that need addressing. They raise awareness of these issues, and therefore try and hold power to account. The Guardian’s reader community responded well to these stories, with the pieces receiving positive comments, with many positive comments, shares and engagement times of over a minute.  The data analysis components of these pieces were mostly conducted in R (mostly dplyr, tidyr) and Google Sheets. The static charts were built in R (ggplot) and final stylistic edits and annotations made in Adobe Illustrator. The interactive charts - in both the international piece on relaxed countries seeing coronavirus increases, and the England modelled 'real' infection rates - were built in d3. ​ "," Finding data on the pandemic has been challenging, with different countries and authorities recording different metrics in slightly different ways. Authorities have also made certain metrics hard to access. This often made data analysis a harder job than usual, meaning that even more care had to be taken when at the checking and verification stage of a project. This was especially true for the “data shows 10 countries risking coronavirus second wave as lockdown relaxed” story.     Also, each of these pieces were collaborative projects, involving work with both other journalists on the Visuals or Data teams, or wider afield with reporters on the news desk. As so many people have come to learn, working from home presents extra challenges when working on collaborative projects. I joined the Guardian during this period of remote working, and so have never actually met some of the people I've worked with on these projects in person. Having to arrange calls instead of simply looking over a colleague’s shoulder, for example, made some of these stories more challenging. However, this challenge has been reduced from the start due to the fact that my colleagues have been so understanding, patient and helpful. The challenge has also been reducing as I become more adapted to remote working, and the process becomes more embedded and efficient in the newsroom.  I think the coronavirus pandemic and the data-led reporting around it has shown how data and visual journalism needs to be at the forefront of the newsroom. Every day, most national and international publications are reporting on newly-published statistics that not only help people understand how the pandemic is progressing, but also help authorities in combating the disease. These numbers are not easy to understand without explanation and context, which is where our job comes in.    Visualisation can help report these numbers in a balanced but engaging way. We can create time series charts to show the trajectory of death rates, or build a map that shows the geographic context of a particular area or countries’ latest case numbers. Without this data journalism, reporting on the the coronavirus pandemic - the most important story of the last year - would be inferior, lacking context and potentially misleading as communities either placed too much or too little emphasis on individual numbers.    The work of data analysis and data visualisation has never been more important.
